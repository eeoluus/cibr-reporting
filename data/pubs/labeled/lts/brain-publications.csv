This review synthesizes physiological and behavioral evidence illustrating how interoceptive signals can mediate or influence bodily self-awareness, by encompassing interactions with various sensory modalities. To deepen our understanding of the basis of bodily self-awareness, we propose a network physiology perspective. This approach explores complex neural computations across multiple nodes, shifting the focus from localized areas to large-scale neural networks.

Nevertheless, traditional group-level ERP analysis methods, including cluster analysis, often overlook critical information about individual subjects’ neural processes due to using fixed measurement intervals derived from averaging. We developed a multi-set consensus clustering pipeline to examine cognitive processes at the individual subject level. Initially, consensus clustering from diverse methods was applied to single-trial EEG epochs of individual subjects. Subsequently, a second level of consensus clustering was performed across the trials of each subject. A newly modified time window determination method was then employed to identify individual subjects’ ERP(s) of interest. We validated our method with simulated data for ERP components N2 and P3, and real data from a visual oddball task to confirm the P3 component. Our findings revealed that estimated time windows for individual subjects provide precise ERP identification compared to fixed time windows across all subjects. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic single-trial data demonstrated stable scores for the N2 and P3 components, confirming the reliability of our method.

IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, Early Access. https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2024.3438829","Objective: Intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) signals are generally recorded using multiple channels, and channel selection is therefore a significant means in studying iEEG-based seizure prediction. For n channels, 2n−1 channel cases can be generated for selection. However, by this means, an increase in n can cause an exponential increase in computational consumption, which may result in a failure of channel selection when n is too large. Hence, it is necessary to explore reasonable channel selection strategies under the premise of controlling computational consumption and ensuring high classification accuracy. Given this, we propose a novel method of channel reordering strategy combined with dual CNN-LSTM for effectively predicting seizures. Method: First, for each patient with n channels, interictal and preictal iEEG samples from each single channel are input into the CNN-LSTM model for classification. Then, the F1-score of each single channel is calculated, and the channels are reordered in descending order according to the size of F1-scores ( channel reordering strategy ). Next, iEEG signals with an increasing number of channels are successively fed into the CNN-LSTM model for classification again. Finally, according to the classification results from n channel cases, the channel case with the highest classification rate is selected. Results: Our method is evaluated on the three iEEG datasets: the Freiburg, the SWEC-ETHZ and the American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge (AES-SPC). At the event-based level, the sensitivities of 100%, 100% and 90.5%, and the false prediction rates (FPRs) of 0.10/h, 0/h and 0.47/h, are achieved for the three datasets, respectively.

However, the effect of sleep quality on the maintenance stage, which is the key to maintain the quality and efficiency of visual working memory representation, remains unclear. This study is the first to explore the effect of sleep quality on the maintenance of visual working memory information.

Method: 60 healthy college students completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and color recall task of visual working memory. A mixed experimental design of sleep quality (high or low) and delay duration (1, 4, or 6 s) was used to assess the effect of sleep quality on the maintenance phase of visual working memory.

Results: The main effects of sleep quality were significant on visual working memory quantity, precision and offset indexes. Among the quantity index, the interaction between sleep quality and delay duration was also significant. This suggests that prolonging the delay time in the maintenance phase leads to difficulty in maintaining attention to the task for those with lower sleep quality, which results in poorer working memory quantitative representations.

Conclusion: Increases in the delay duration of the maintenance phase in visual working memory intensify the impact of sleep quality on task performance.

However, the most common instruction of “do the task quickly and accurately” does not highlight the importance of the balance between being fast and accurate.

Methods: Our research aimed to explore how instructions about speed or accuracy affect perceptual process, focus on event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs) of two brain responses for visual stimuli, known as P1 and N1. Additionally, we compared the conventional analysis approach with principal component analysis (PCA) based methods to analyze P1 and N1 ERP amplitude and ERO power.

Results: The results showed that individuals instructed to respond quickly had lower P1 amplitude and alpha ERO than those who prioritized accuracy, using the PCA-based approach. However, these two groups had no differences between groups in the N1 theta band using both methods. The traditional time-frequency analysis method could not detect any ERP or ERO distinctions between groups due to limitations in detecting specific components in time or frequency domains. That means PCA is effective in separating these components.

Discussion: Our findings indicate that the instructions given regarding speed and accuracy impact perceptual process of subjects during cognitive behavioral experiments. We suggest that future researchers should choose their instructions carefully, considering the purpose of study.","Introduction: In cognitive behavioral experiments, we often asked participants to make judgments within a deadline.

Consequently, there have been increased efforts to develop bedside assessment based on EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs) that are more sensitive to the neural factors supporting conscious awareness. However, individual detection of residual consciousness using these techniques is less established. Here, we hypothesize that the cross-state similarity (defined as the similarity between healthy and impaired conscious states) of passive brain responses to auditory stimuli can index the level of awareness in individual DOC patients. To this end, we introduce the global field time-frequency representation-based discriminative similarity analysis (GFTFR-DSA). This method quantifies the average cross-state similarity index between an individual patient and our constructed healthy templates using the GFTFR as an EEG feature. We demonstrate that the proposed GFTFR feature exhibits superior within-group consistency in 34 healthy controls over traditional EEG features such as temporal waveforms. Second, we observed the GFTFR-based similarity index was significantly higher in patients with a minimally conscious state (MCS, 40 patients) than those with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS, 54 patients), supporting our hypothesis. Finally, applying a linear support vector machine classifier for individual MCS/UWS classification, the model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.77. Overall, our findings indicate that combining discriminative and interpretable markers, along with automatic machine learning algorithms, is effective for the differential diagnosis in patients with DOC.

This study’s purpose was to investigate how nurses, using a picture schedule, enable or hinder the realization of disabled children’s agency in the preparation for an MRI procedure carried out under general anaesthesia.

Methods
A qualitative observation study was used to explore the interaction of nurses and children. The data consisted of video recordings of 25 preparation situations of 3 (3–8 years old) children (with challenges in communication and/or cognitive skills) with 4 nurses. Verbal and nonverbal communication was analysed with interventionist applied conversation analysis.

Results
What was most crucial was how the picture schedule was used during the interaction. Reciprocal information sharing, responding to the child’s initiatives by negotiating and allowing the child to take physical action with the picture schedule enabled the realization of the child’s agency.

Conclusions
The preparation process should aim to help the child prepare in his/her own way. The preparation tools should encourage reciprocal interaction in informing and in responding to the children’s initiatives. The preparation practices should include enough time for the child’s initiatives and physical participation. The results can be used in assessing preparation tools and how they are used from the perspective of the child’s agency.","Purpose

Further, adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in the dentate gyrus (DG) has also been linked to learning. To study hippocampal neuronal activity during events like learning, in vivo calcium imaging has become increasingly popular. It relies on the use of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, which seem to lead to a decrease in AHN when applied on the DG. More notably, imaging requires the implantation of a relatively large lens into the tissue. Here, we examined how injection of an AAV vector and implantation of a 1-mm-diameter lens into the dorsal DG routinely used to image calcium activity impact the behavior of adult male C57BL/6 mice. To this aim, we conducted open-field, object-recognition and object-location tasks at baseline, after AAV vector injection, and after lens implantation. Finally, we determined AHN from hippocampal slices using a doublecortin-antibody. According to our results, the operations needed for in vivo imaging of the dorsal DG did not have adverse effects on behavior, although we noticed a decrease in AHN ipsilaterally to the operations. Thus, our results suggest that in vivo imaging can be safely used to, for example, correlate patterns of calcium activity with learned behavior. One should still keep in mind that the defects on the operated side might be functionally compensated by the (hippocampus in the) contralateral hemisphere.","Hippocampus is essential for episodic memory formation, lesion studies demonstrating its role especially in processing spatial and temporal information. Further, adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in the dentate gyrus (DG) has also been linked to learning.

The other objective was to determine cross-sectional associations of motor fitness and muscular strength with brain function in adolescence.

Methods: In 45 healthy adolescents (25 girls and 20 boys) aged 16–19 years, we assessed cortical excitability and inhibition by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), and motor fitness by 50-m shuttle run test and Box and block test, and muscular strength by standing long jump test. These measures of physical fitness and CRF by maximal exercise were assessed also at the ages 7–9, 9–11, and 15–17 years. Cumulative measures of physical measures were computed by summing up sample-specific z-scores at ages 7–9, 9–11, and 15–17 years.

Results: Higher cumulative motor fitness performance from childhood to adolescence was associated with lower right hemisphere resting motor threshold (rMT), lower silent period threshold (SPt), and lower motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude in boys. Better childhood-to-adolescence cumulative CRF was also associated with longer silent period (SP) duration in boys and higher MEP amplitude in girls. Cross-sectionally in adolescence, better motor fitness and better muscular strength were associated with lower left and right rMT among boys and better motor fitness was associated with higher MEP amplitude and better muscular strength with lower SPt among girls.

Conclusion: Physical fitness from childhood to adolescence modifies cortical excitability and inhibition in adolescence.

This phenomenon is commonly attributed to visual memorability, a collection of stimulus attributes that enhance the long-term retention of visual information. However, the exact contributions of visual memorability to visual memory formation remain elusive as these effects could emerge anywhere from early perceptual encoding to post-perceptual memory consolidation processes. To clarify this, we tested three key predictions from the hypothesis that visual memorability facilitates early perceptual encoding that supports the formation of visual short-term memory (VSTM) and the retention of visual long-term memory (VLTM). First, we examined whether memorability benefits in VSTM encoding manifest early, even within the constraints of a brief stimulus presentation (100–200 ms; Experiment 1). We achieved this by manipulating stimulus presentation duration in a VSTM change detection task using face images with high- or low-memorability while ensuring they were equally familiar to the participants.

Across experiments, our data suggest that visual memorability has an early impact on VSTM formation, persisting across variable retention intervals and predicting subsequent VLTM overnight.

Preclinical studies have shown the therapeutic potential of VEGF-B (vascular endothelial growth factor B) in revascularization of the ischemic myocardium, but the associated cardiac hypertrophy and adverse side effects remain a concern. To understand the importance of endothelial proliferation and migration for the beneficial versus adverse effects of VEGF-B in the heart, we explored the cardiac effects of autocrine versus paracrine VEGF-B expression in transgenic and gene-transduced mice.
METHODS:
We used single-cell RNA sequencing to compare cardiac endothelial gene expression in VEGF-B transgenic mouse models. Lineage tracing was used to identify the origin of a VEGF-B-induced novel endothelial cell population and adeno-associated virus–mediated gene delivery to compare the effects of VEGF-B isoforms. Cardiac function was investigated using echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and micro-computed tomography.
RESULTS:
Unlike in physiological cardiac hypertrophy driven by a cardiomyocyte-specific VEGF-B transgene (myosin heavy chain alpha-VEGF-B), autocrine VEGF-B expression in cardiac endothelium (aP2 [adipocyte protein 2]-VEGF-B) was associated with septal defects and failure to increase perfused subendocardial capillaries postnatally. Paracrine VEGF-B led to robust proliferation and myocardial migration of a novel cardiac endothelial cell lineage (VEGF-B-induced endothelial cells) of endocardial origin, whereas autocrine VEGF-B increased proliferation of VEGF-B-induced endothelial cells but failed to promote their migration and efficient contribution to myocardial capillaries. The surviving aP2-VEGF-B offspring showed an altered ratio of secreted VEGF-B isoforms and developed massive pathological cardiac hypertrophy with a distinct cardiac vessel pattern. In the normal heart, we found a small VEGF-B-induced endothelial cell population that was only minimally expanded during myocardial infarction but not during physiological cardiac hypertrophy associated with mouse pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS:
Paracrine and autocrine secretions of VEGF-B induce expansion of a specific endocardium-derived endothelial cell population with distinct angiogenic markers. However, autocrine VEGF-B signaling fails to promote VEGF-B-induced endothelial cell migration and contribution to myocardial capillaries, predisposing to septal defects and inducing a mismatch between angiogenesis and myocardial growth, which results in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.","BACKGROUND:

Unlike in physiological cardiac hypertrophy driven by a cardiomyocyte-specific VEGF-B transgene (myosin heavy chain alpha-VEGF-B), autocrine VEGF-B expression in cardiac endothelium (aP2 [adipocyte protein 2]-VEGF-B) was associated with septal defects and failure to increase perfused subendocardial capillaries postnatally. Paracrine VEGF-B led to robust proliferation and myocardial migration of a novel cardiac endothelial cell lineage (VEGF-B-induced endothelial cells) of endocardial origin, whereas autocrine VEGF-B increased proliferation of VEGF-B-induced endothelial cells but failed to promote their migration and efficient contribution to myocardial capillaries. The surviving aP2-VEGF-B offspring showed an altered ratio of secreted VEGF-B isoforms and developed massive pathological cardiac hypertrophy with a distinct cardiac vessel pattern. In the normal heart, we found a small VEGF-B-induced endothelial cell population that was only minimally expanded during myocardial infarction but not during physiological cardiac hypertrophy associated with mouse pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS:
Paracrine and autocrine secretions of VEGF-B induce expansion of a specific endocardium-derived endothelial cell population with distinct angiogenic markers. However, autocrine VEGF-B signaling fails to promote VEGF-B-induced endothelial cell migration and contribution to myocardial capillaries, predisposing to septal defects and inducing a mismatch between angiogenesis and myocardial growth, which results in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.","Magneettikuvaus"

Diseases affecting sensorimotor function impair physical independence. Reliable functional clinical biomarkers allowing early diagnosis or targeting treatment and rehabilitation could reduce this burden. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) non-invasively measures brain rhythms such as the somatomotor ‘rolandic’ rhythm which shows intermittent high-amplitude beta (14-30Hz) ‘events’ that predict behavior across tasks and species and are altered by sensorimotor neurological diseases.

Methods
We assessed test-retest stability, a prerequisite for biomarkers, of spontaneous sensorimotor aperiodic (1/f) signal and beta events in 50 healthy human controls across two MEG sessions using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Beta events were determined using an amplitude-thresholding approach on a narrow-band filtered amplitude envelope obtained using Morlet wavelet decomposition.

Results
Resting sensorimotor characteristics showed good to excellent test-retest stability. Aperiodic component (ICC 0.77-0.88) and beta event amplitude (ICC 0.74-0.82) were very stable, whereas beta event duration was more variable (ICC 0.55-0.7). 2-3 minute recordings were sufficient to obtain stable results. Analysis automatization was successful in 86%.

Conclusions
Sensorimotor beta phenotype is a stable feature of an individual’s resting brain activity even for short recordings easily measured in patients.

Strength training mitigates the age-related decline in strength and muscle activation but limited evidence exists on specific motor pathway adaptations.

Methods
Eleven young (22–34 years) and ten older (66–80 years) adults underwent five testing sessions where lumbar-evoked potentials (LEPs) and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured during 20 and 60% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Ten stimulations, randomly delivered, targeted 25% of maximum compound action potential for LEPs and 120, 140, and 160% of active motor threshold (aMT) for MEPs. The 7-week whole-body resistance training intervention included five exercises, e.g., knee extension (5 sets) and leg press (3 sets), performed twice weekly and was followed by 4 weeks of detraining.

Results
Young had higher MVC (~ 63 N·m, p = 0.006), 1-RM (~ 50 kg, p = 0.002), and lower aMT (~ 9%, p = 0.030) than older adults at baseline. Young increased 1-RM (+ 18 kg, p < 0.001), skeletal muscle mass (SMM) (+ 0.9 kg, p = 0.009), and LEP amplitude (+ 0.174, p < 0.001) during 20% MVC. Older adults increased MVC (+ 13 N·m, p = 0.014), however, they experienced decreased LEP amplitude (− 0.241, p < 0.001) during 20% MVC and MEP amplitude reductions at 120% (− 0.157, p = 0.034), 140% (− 0.196, p = 0.026), and 160% (− 0.210, p = 0.006) aMT during 60% MVC trials. After detraining, young and older adults decreased 1-RM, while young adults decreased SMM.

Conclusion
Higher aMT and MEP amplitude in older adults were concomitant with lower baseline strength. Training increased strength in both groups, but divergent modifications in cortico-spinal activity occurred. Results suggest that the primary locus of adaptation occurs at the spinal level.","Introduction

There has been a growing interest in studying brain activity under naturalistic conditions. However, the relationship between individual differences in ongoing brain activity and psychological characteristics is not well understood. We investigated this connection, focusing on the association between oscillatory activity in the brain and individually characteristic dispositional traits. Given the variability of unconstrained resting states among individuals, we devised a paradigm that could harmonize the state of mind across all participants.

Methods
We constructed task contrasts that included focused attention (FA), self-centered future planning, and rumination on anxious thoughts triggered by visual imagery. Magnetoencephalography was recorded from 28 participants under these 3 conditions for a duration of 16 min. The oscillatory power in the alpha and beta bands was converted into spatial contrast maps, representing the difference in brain oscillation power between the two conditions. We performed permutation cluster tests on these spatial contrast maps. Additionally, we applied penalized canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to study the relationship between brain oscillation patterns and behavioral traits.

Results
The data revealed that the FA condition, as compared to the other conditions, was associated with higher alpha and beta power in the temporal areas of the left hemisphere and lower alpha and beta power in the parietal areas of the right hemisphere. Interestingly, the penalized CCA indicated that behavioral inhibition was positively correlated, whereas anxiety was negatively correlated, with a pattern of high oscillatory power in the bilateral precuneus and low power in the bilateral temporal regions. This unique association was found in the anxious-thoughts condition when contrasted with the focused-attention condition.

Conclusion
Our findings suggest individual temperament traits significantly affect brain engagement in naturalistic conditions. This research underscores the importance of considering individual traits in neuroscience and offers an effective method for analyzing brain activity and psychological differences.","Introduction

Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data
Objective. 
To evaluate how preexisting adjacent segment degeneration status impacts revision risk for adjacent segment disease (ASD) after lumbar fusions.
Summary of Background Data. 
ASD incurs late reoperations after lumbar fusion surgeries. ASD pathogenesis is multifactorial. Preexisting adjacent segment degeneration measured by Pfirrmann is suggested as one of the predisposing factors. We sought to find deeper insights into this association by using a more granular degeneration measure, the Combined imaging score (CIS).
Methods. 
A total of 197 consecutive lumbar fusions for degenerative pathologies were enrolled in a prospective follow-up (median 12 years). Preoperative cranial adjacent segment degeneration status was determined using Pfirrmann and CIS, which utilizes both radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. Based on CIS, patients were trichotomized into tertiles (CIS <7, CIS 7–10, and CIS >10). The cumulative ASD revision risk was determined for each tertile. After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, sacral fixation, and fusion length, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals, CI) for ASD revisions were determined for each Pfirrmann and CIS score.
Results. 
Patients in the intermediate CIS tertile had a cumulative ASD revision risk of 25.4% (17.0% to 37.0%), while both milder degeneration (CIS <7) [13.2% (6.5% to 25.8%)] and end-stage degeneration (CIS >10) [13.6% (7.0% to 25.5%)] appeared to be protective against surgical ASD. Pfirrmann failed to show a significant association with ASD revision risk. Adjusted analysis of CIS suggested increased ASD revisions after CIS 7, which turned contrariwise after CIS 10.
Conclusions. 
The effect of preexisting adjacent segment degeneration on ASD reoperation risk is not linear. The risk seems to increase with advancing degeneration but diminish with end-stage degeneration. Therefore, end-stage degenerative segments may be considered to be excluded from fusion constructs.

Patients in the intermediate CIS tertile had a cumulative ASD revision risk of 25.4% (17.0% to 37.0%), while both milder degeneration (CIS <7) [13.2% (6.5% to 25.8%)] and end-stage degeneration (CIS >10) [13.6% (7.0% to 25.5%)] appeared to be protective against surgical ASD. Pfirrmann failed to show a significant association with ASD revision risk. Adjusted analysis of CIS suggested increased ASD revisions after CIS 7, which turned contrariwise after CIS 10.
Conclusions. 
The effect of preexisting adjacent segment degeneration on ASD reoperation risk is not linear. The risk seems to increase with advancing degeneration but diminish with end-stage degeneration. Therefore, end-stage degenerative segments may be considered to be excluded from fusion constructs.

Procedure: We followed 317 children (3–6 years) over two years. Fundamental motor skills and executive functions (inhibition+switching, updating) were measured at all time points (T1, T2, T3) and physical activity at T1 and early numeracy at T3.

Main findings: Children with better fundamental motor skills at T1 developed slower in inhibition and switching. Fundamental motor skills developed faster in children who had better initial inhibition and switching ability. Vigorous physical activity at T1 was associated with a weaker initial inhibition and switching. The initial level and the developmental rate of updating were related to better early numeracy skills.

Conclusions: Findings indicate that fundamental motor skills and executive functions are developmentally related, and updating is an important predictor for early numeracy in preschoolers.","Background: Physical activity, fundamental motor skills, executive functions and early numeracy have shown to be related, but very little is known about the developmental relations of these factors.

Our objective was to clarify the primary sensorimotor (SM1) cortex excitatory and inhibitory alterations in hemiplegic (HP) and diplegic (DP) cerebral palsy (CP) by quantifying SM1 cortex beta power suppression and rebound with magnetoencephalography (MEG).

Methods
MEG was recorded from 16 HP and 12 DP adolescents, and their 32 healthy controls during proprioceptive stimulation of the index fingers evoked by a movement actuator. The related beta power changes were computed with Temporal Spectral Evolution (TSE). Peak strengths of beta suppression and rebound were determined from representative channels over the SM1 cortex.

Results
Beta suppression was stronger contralateral to the stimulus and rebound was weaker ipsilateral to the stimulation in DP compared to controls. Beta modulation strengths did not differ significantly between HP and the control group.

Conclusions
The emphasized beta suppression in DP suggests less efficient proprioceptive processing in the SM1 contralateral to the stimulation. Their weak rebound further indicates reduced intra- and/or interhemispheric cortical inhibition, which is a potential neuronal mechanism for their bilateral motor impairments.

Significance
The excitation-inhibition balance of the SM1 cortex related to proprioception is impaired in diplegic CP. Therefore, the cortical and behavioral proprioceptive deficits should be better diagnosed and considered to better target individualized effective rehabilitation in CP.","Objective

International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology, 24(1), Article 100426. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2023.100426","Background
Emerging research supports the idea that physical activity benefits brain development. However, the body of evidence focused on understanding the effects of physical activity on white matter microstructure during childhood is still in its infancy, and further well-designed randomized clinical trials are needed.

Aim
This study aimed: (i) to investigate the effects of a 20-week physical activity intervention on global white matter microstructure in children with overweight or obesity, and (ii) to explore whether the effect of physical activity on white matter microstructure is global or restricted to a particular set of white matter bundles.

Methods
In total, 109 children aged 8 to 11 years with overweight or obesity were randomized and allocated to either the physical activity program or the control group. Data were collected from November 2014 to June 2016, with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data processing and analyses conducted between June 2017 and November 2021. Images were pre-processed using the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain´s Software Library (FSL) and white matter properties were explored by probabilistic fiber tractography and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).

Results
Intention-to-treat analyses were performed for all children who completed the pre-test and post-test DTI assessment, with good quality DTI data (N = 89). Of them, 83 children (10.06±1.11 years, 39 % girls, intervention group=44) met the per-protocol criteria (attended at least 70 % of the recommended sessions). Our probabilistic fiber tractography analysis did not show any effects in terms of global and tract-specific fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in the per-protocol or intention-to-treat analyses. Additionally, we did not observe any effects on the voxel-wise DTI parameters (i.e., FA and MD) using the most restricted TBSS approach (i.e., per protocol analyses and p-corrected image with a statistical threshold of p < 0.05). In the intention-to-treat analysis, we found that our physical activity program had a borderline effect (p-corrected image with a statistical threshold of p < 0.1) on 7 different clusters, including a cluster in the corpus callosum.

Conclusion
We conclude that a 20-week physical activity intervention was not enough to induce changes in global and tract-specific white matter during childhood. The effects of physical activity on white matter microstructure could be restricted to local changes in several white matter tracts (e.g., the body of the corpus callosum). However, our results were not significant, and more interventions are needed to determine whether and how physical activity affects white matter microstructure during childhood.","Background

Methods
This study investigated spinal excitability at different time delays within the TMS-evoked SP in m.rectus femoris. Fifteen participants performed non-fatiguing isometric knee extensions at 25%, 50% and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Lumbar stimulation (LS) induced a lumbar-evoked potential (LEP) of 50% resting M-max. TMS stimulator output induced a SP lasting ~ 200 ms. In each contraction, a LEP (unconditioned) was delivered ~ 2–3 s prior to TMS, which was followed by a second LEP (conditioned) 60, 90, 120 or 150 ms into the silent period. Five contractions were performed at each contraction intensity and for each time delay in random order.

Results
Compared to the unconditioned LEP, the conditioned LEP amplitude was reduced (− 28 ± 34%, p = 0.007) only at 60 ms during 25% of MVC. Conditioned LEP amplitudes during 50% and 75% of MVC were reduced at 60 ms (− 37 ± 47%, p = 0.009 and − 37 ± 42%, p = 0.005, respectively) and 150 ms (− 30% ± 37%, p = 0.0083 and − 37 ± 43%, p = 0.005, respectively). LEP amplitude at 90 ms during 50% of MVC also reduced (− 25 ± 35%, p = 0.013).

Conclusion
Reduced spinal excitability is extended during 50% and 75% of MVC. In future, paired TMS-LS could be a potential method to understand changes in spinal excitability during SP (at different contraction intensities) when testing various neurophysiological phenomena.","Purpose

To assess the effects to functional connectivity (FC) caused by lesions related to spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (CP) in children and adolescents using multiple imaging modalities.

Methods
We used resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) envelope signals in alpha, beta and gamma ranges and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals to quantify FC between selected sensorimotor regions of interest (ROIs) in 11 adolescents with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy and 24 typically developing controls. Motor performance of the hands was quantified with gross motor, fine motor and kinesthesia tests.

Results
In fMRI, participants with CP showed enhanced FC within posterior parietal regions; in MEG, they showed enhanced interhemispheric FC between sensorimotor regions and posterior parietal regions both in alpha and lower beta bands. There was a correlation between the kinesthesia score and fronto-parietal connectivity in the control population.

Conclusions
CP is associated with enhanced FC in sensorimotor network. This difference is not correlated with hand coordination performance. The effect of the lesion is likely not fully captured by temporal correlation of ROI signals.

Significance
Brain lesions can show as increased temporal correlation of activity between remote brain areas. We suggest this effect is likely separate from typical physiological correlates of functional connectivity.","Objective

To investigate whether a 20-week aerobic and resistance exercise program induces changes in brain current density underlying working memory and inhibitory control in children with overweight/obesity.

Methods
A total of 67 children (10.00 ± 1.10 years) were randomized into an exercise or control group. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based current density (μA/mm2) was estimated using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) during a working memory task (Delayed non-matched-to-sample task, DNMS) and inhibitory control task (Modified flanker task, MFT). In DNMS, participants had to memorize four stimuli (Pokemons) and then select between two of them, one of which had not been previously shown. In MFT, participants had to indicate whether the centered cow (i.e., target) of five faced the right or left.

Results
The exercise group had significantly greater increases in brain activation in comparison with the control group during the encoding phase of DNMS, particularly during retention of second stimuli in temporal and frontal areas (peak t = from 3.4 to 3.8, cluster size [k] = from 11 to 39), during the retention of the third stimuli in frontal areas (peak t = from 3.7 to 3.9, k = from 15 to 26), and during the retention of the fourth stimuli in temporal and occipital areas (peak t = from 2.7 to 4.3, k = from 13 to 101). In MFT, the exercise group presented a lower current density change in the middle frontal gyrus (peak t = −4.1, k = 5). No significant change was observed between groups for behavioral performance (p ≥ 0.05).

Conclusion
A 20-week exercise program modulates brain activity which might provide a positive influence on working memory and inhibitory control in children with overweight/obesity.","Objective

To compare the effectiveness of a McKenzie Method intervention in patients with sciatica with guideline-based patient education.
Design
Multi-centre, assessor-blinded, parallel-group, randomised trial
Setting
Two tertiary hospitals providing operative spinal care.
Subjects
Sciatica patients with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed lumbar disc herniation compressing a nerve root.
Interventions
The McKenzie group received specific back exercises for seven visits combined with an educational book, and the Control group received a single session of self-management guidance according to usual practices.
Main measures
The primary outcome was the number of surgical operations. Secondary outcomes were pain measured using the Visual Analogue Scale, disability using the Oswestry Disability Index and health-related quality of life using a RAND-36 questionnaire at baseline and 24-month follow-up.
Results
Altogether 66 patients, mean age of 43 years, of which 50% were females with long-lasting sciatica, mean 16 weeks, were randomised to two groups. Nineteen patients (29%) had surgery. There was no significant difference in surgery rates between the groups. Back and leg pain decreased, and disability improved in both groups. Health-related quality of life improved in six dimensions out of eight in both groups. There were no significant between-group changes in the patient-reported outcomes at the follow-up.
Conclusions
Multiple sessions of McKenzie-based back exercises with a McKenzie-specific patient's educational book produced effects equal to guideline-based advice at long-term follow-up. However, the power of these results is diminished due to the small patient population and confounding factors.","Objective

International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery, 19(1), 87-96. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-023-02931-0","Purpose: The training of deep medical image segmentation networks usually requires a large amount of human-annotated data. To alleviate the burden of human labor, many semi- or non-supervised methods have been developed. However, due to the complexity of clinical scenario, insufficient training labels still causes inaccurate segmentation in some difficult local areas such as heterogeneous tumors and fuzzy boundaries. 
Methods: We propose an annotation-efficient training approach, which only requires scribble guidance in the difficult areas. A segmentation network is initially trained with a small amount of fully annotated data and then used to produce pseudo labels for more training data. Human supervisors draw scribbles in the areas of incorrect pseudo labels (i.e., difficult areas), and the scribbles are converted into pseudo label maps using a probability-modulated geodesic transform. To reduce the influence of the potential errors in the pseudo labels, a confidence map of the pseudo labels is generated by jointly considering the pixel-to-scribble geodesic distance and the network output probability. The pseudo labels and confidence maps are iteratively optimized with the update of the network, and the network training is promoted by the pseudo labels and the confidence maps in turn. 
Results: Cross-validation based on two data sets (brain tumor MRI and liver tumor CT) showed that our method significantly reduces the annotation time while maintains the segmentation accuracy of difficult areas (e.g., tumors). Using 90 scribbleannotated training images (annotated time: ~ 9 h), our method achieved the same performance as using 45 fully annotated images (annotation time: > 100 h) but required much shorter annotation time. 
Conclusion: Compared to the conventional full annotation approaches, the proposed method significantly saves the annotation efforts by focusing the human supervisions on the most difficult regions. It provides an annotation-efficient way for training medical image segmentation networks in complex clinical scenario.","Purpose: The training of deep medical image segmentation networks usually requires a large amount of human-annotated data.

LICA has emerged as a powerful technique for analyzing multivariate data, particularly in neuroimaging and biomedical signal processing. The performance of LICA can be affected by the number of subjects and modalities. However, the detailed influence of the number of subjects and modalities on its performance remains an open question. In this study, we test the effects of the number of subjects and modalities on the performance of LICA using both simulated multimodal MRI data and the real multimodal MRI datasets from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II (ABIDE II). Simulated data were utilized to evaluate the influence of subjects and modalities' variabilities. Real multi-site MRI data were used to demonstrate the advantages of multimodal fusion in identifying site-related components and removing site effects. Based on the simulation results, we found that increasing the number of modalities and subjects can improve the results when LICA can not recover the spatial maps or subject courses well. The correlation among subject courses from various modalities, the number of modalities, and the choice of components for decomposition all affect the linking performance of LICA. Our results from real-world datasets also demonstrated the advantages of multimodal fusion by LICA: 1) identify more site-related components; 2) remove more site effects.","In recent years, neuroimaging studies have increasingly been acquiring multiple modalities of data.

To examine the association between physical activity, sedentary time, and physical fitness with the shapes of subcortical brain structures in children with overweight/obesity. Further, we analyzed whether differences in the shapes of subcortical brain structures were related to intelligence. We hypothesized that those children with higher physical activity levels, lower sedentary time, and better fitness, would show greater expansion of the brain regions analyzed, and these expansions would be associated with higher intelligence.

Study Design
100 children (10.0 ± 1.1 years, 40 girls) were included in the analyses. Physical activity and sedentary time were measured by accelerometry, and physical fitness was evaluated by a fitness battery. Shapes of subcortical brain structures were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Intelligence was measured by the Kaufmann Brief Intelligence test.

Results
Physical activity was related to expansion of the right/left pallidum, right/left putamen, and right thalamus (p < 0.05). Higher sedentary time was related to contraction of the left thalamus and right nucleus accumbens (p < 0.05). Higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with expansion of the right amygdala (p = 0.022). Greater strength in the upper-limb was related to expansion of the right/left pallidum and the left nucleus accumbens (p < 0.038), and contraction of the left amygdala (p = 0.030). Better speed-agility was associated with expansion of the left nucleus accumbens (p = 0.036). Physical activity- and fitness-related expansion of the right pallidum was associated with higher intelligence (all p < 0.05).

Conclusion
Physical activity, sedentary time, and physical fitness were significantly related to the shapes of subcortical brain structures, which in turn were related to intelligence in children with overweight/obesity.","Objectives

Fat depots localization has a critical role in the metabolic health status of adults. Nevertheless, whether that is also the case in children remains under-studied. Therefore, the aims of this study were: (i) to examine the differences between metabolically healthy (MHO) and unhealthy (MUO) overweight/obesity phenotypes on specific abdominal fat depots, and (ii) to further explore whether cardiorespiratory fitness plays a major role in the differences between metabolic phenotypes among children with overweight/obesity.

Methods
A total of 114 children with overweight/obesity (10.6 ± 1.1 years, 62 girls) were included. Children were classified as MHO (n = 68) or MUO. visceral (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT), intermuscular abdominal (IMAAT), psoas, hepatic, pancreatic, and lumbar bone marrow adipose tissues were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using the 20 m shuttle run test.

Results
MHO children had lower VAT and ASAT contents and psoas fat fraction compared to MUO children (difference = 12.4%–25.8%, all p < 0.035). MUO-unfit had more VAT and ASAT content than those MUO-fit and MHO-fit (difference = 34.8%–45.3%, all p < 0.044).

Conclusions
VAT together with ASAT and psoas fat fraction, were lower in MHO than in MUO children. Further, we also observed that being fit, regardless of metabolic phenotype, has a protective role over the specific abdominal fat depots among children with overweight/obesity.","Objectives

Emerging research supports the idea that exercise positively affects neurodevelopment. However, the mechanisms linking exercise with brain health are largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the effect of exercise on (a) blood biomarkers selected based on previous evidence (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), cathepsin B (CTSB), kynurenine, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1)); and (b) a panel of 92 neurology-related proteins (discovery analysis). We also investigated whether changes in these biomarkers mediate the effects of exercise on brain health (hippocampal structure and function, cognitive performance, and mental health).
Methods
We randomized 81 overweight/obese children (10.1 ± 1.1 years, 41% girls) into 2 groups: either 20 weeks of aerobic plus resistance exercise or control. Candidate biomarkers were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for kynurenine, FGF21, and CTSB; colorimetry for β-hydroxybutyrate; and XMap for brain-derived neurotrophic factor and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. The 92 neurology-related proteins were analyzed by an antibody-based proteomic analysis.
Results
Our intervention had no significant effect on candidate biomarkers (all p > 0.05). In the discovery analysis, a reduction in circulating macrophage scavenger receptor type-I was observed (standardized differences between groups = –0.3, p = 0.001). This effect was validated using ELISA methods (standardized difference = –0.3, p = 0.01). None of the biomarkers mediated the effects of exercise on brain health.
Conclusions
Our study does not support a chronic effect of exercise on candidate biomarkers. We observed that while chronic exercise reduced the levels of macrophage scavenger receptor type-I, it did not mediate the effects of exercise on brain health. Future studies should explore the implications of this novel biomarker for overall health.","Background

Brain and Behavior, 13(11), Article e3252. https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.3252","Introduction
Chronic pain associates with various sleep problems. Patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) often report impaired sleep, but objective measurements of sleep in CRPS patients are scarce. Neuromodulation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can alleviate pain and improve sleep. Secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) is a possible rTMS target for the treatment of chronic pain, but the effect of S2-targeted rTMS on sleep is unknown.

Methods
This randomized, sham-controlled trial assessed the effect of S2-targeted rTMS on sleep in patients with CRPS. Patients (n = 31) received either S2-targeted rTMS (10 Hz) or sham stimulation for 3 weeks. The effect of treatment on sleep was assessed with validated questionnaires, with a sleep and pain diary, and with a consumer-grade sleep tracker, the Oura ring. In addition to an ordinary univariate analysis of the results, we conducted multivariate testing of the Oura data using linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

Results
S2-targeted rTMS decreased sleep restlessness that significantly differed between the rTMS and sham stimulation patient groups (p = .028). In the multivariate analysis of the Oura data, LDA classification accuracy to separate the rTMS and sham groups exceeded 95% confidence level in four out of the seven tested models. In the subjective evaluation of sleep, the effect of rTMS and sham did not differ.

Conclusion
S2-targeted rTMS influenced sleep in patients with CRPS. Improved sleep may enhance CRPS symptom alleviation and be of clinical importance. A univariate analysis could separate the rTMS and sham treatments. The multivariate analysis revealed that including multiple sleep-related parameters can be beneficial when analyzing rTMS effects on sleep. As sleep is related both to pain and quality of life, and sleep rTMS can be directly affected by rTMS, objective monitoring of sleep in various future rTMS trials could be fruitful.","Introduction

However, the multiple mechanisms underlying the peripheral–central inflammatory signaling are still not fully characterized. We used intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in freely moving mice with chronically implanted electrodes for recording of local field potentials (LFP) and electrocorticography (ECoG) in the hippocampus and neocortex, respectively. We show here that a sudden switch in the mode of network activity occurred in both areas starting at 10–15 min after the LPS injection, simultaneously with a robust change from exploration to sickness behavior. This switch in cortical mode commenced before any elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNFα, CCL2 or IL-6 were detected in brain tissue. Thereafter, this mode dominated cortical activity for the recording period of 3 h, except for a partial and transient recovery around 40 min post-LPS. These effects were closely paralleled by changes in ECoG spectral entropy. Continuous recordings for up to 72 h showed a protracted attenuation in hippocampal activity, while neocortical activity recovered after 48 h. The acute sickness behavior recovered by 72 h post-LPS. Notably, urethane (1.3 mg/kg) administered prior to LPS blocked the early effect of LPS on cortical activity. However, experiments under urethane anesthesia which were started 24 h post-LPS (with neuroinflammation fully developed before application of urethane) showed that both theta–supratheta and fast gamma CA1 activity were reduced, DG delta activity was increased, and sharp-wave ripples were abolished. Finally, we observed that experimental compensation of inflammation-induced hypothermia 24–48 h post-LPS promoted seizures and status epilepticus; and that LPS decreased the threshold of kainate-provoked seizures beyond the duration of acute sickness behavior indicating post-acute inflammatory hyperexcitability. Taken together, the strikingly fast development and initial independence of brain cytokines of the LPS-induced cortical mode, its spectral characteristics and simultaneity in hippocampus and neocortex, as well as inhibition by pre-applied urethane, strongly suggest that the underlying mechanisms are based on activation of the afferent vagus nerve and its mainly cholinergic ascending projections to higher brain areas.","Systemic inflammation triggers protective as well as pro-inflammatory responses in the brain based on neuronal and/or cytokine signaling, and it associates with acutely and protractedly disrupted cognition.

Significance Statement

While predictive coding is postulated as a fundamental principle of brain function, little is known about its developmental trajectory in normal aging. This is in stark contrast with the large body of research on age-related decline in cognition such as working memory, which could be conceptualised as a derivative of the predictive coding mechanism. Here we provided longitudinal evidence that the hierarchy-selective attenuation of prediction errors manifests as a stable feature while working memory deteriorates with advancing age. Correlation analysis further suggested that the attenuation of prediction errors is likely a precursor of working memory decline, rendering it a potential predictor of working memory deterioration before any clinically relevant symptoms would manifest in the aging population.","From the perspective of predictive coding, normal aging is accompanied by decreased weighting of sensory inputs and increased reliance on predictions, resulting in the attenuation of prediction errors in older age.

This is in stark contrast with the large body of research on age-related decline in cognition such as working memory, which could be conceptualised as a derivative of the predictive coding mechanism. Here we provided longitudinal evidence that the hierarchy-selective attenuation of prediction errors manifests as a stable feature while working memory deteriorates with advancing age. Correlation analysis further suggested that the attenuation of prediction errors is likely a precursor of working memory decline, rendering it a potential predictor of working memory deterioration before any clinically relevant symptoms would manifest in the aging population.","EEG"

To compare if the degenerative findings from MRI differ between the sciatica patients classified as centralizers (CEN) and non-centralizers (Non-CEN) according to the McKenzie Method of mechanical diagnosis and therapy.
Study Design
A cross-sectional study.
Methods
Patients (N = 100) referred to a spine clinic of a single tertiary hospital for specialist consultation for sciatica. The McKenzie-based assessment was performed by the mechanical diagnosis and therapy-trained physiotherapists. Clinical data and prevalence of lumbar MRI findings were compared between the groups.
Results
There was no significant difference in leg pain intensity between the groups. The Non-CEN had significantly more intense back pain, mean 56 (SD 30) and were more disabled 44 (SD 15) compared to the CEN mean 41 (SD 25) and mean 31 (11), measured with a visual analogue scale (0–100), and the Oswestry Disability Index (0–100), respectively. The CEN had more severe degenerative findings on MRI than the Non-CEN: vertebral end-plate changes were 63% and 43%; mean Pfirrmann’s disc degeneration lumbar summary score was 12.8, and 10.6; and severity score of total damage was 12.0 and 10.1, respectively. There were differences neither in disc contour changes nor nerve root stenosis on MRI.
Conclusions
Sciatica patients classified as non-centralizers had significantly more severe back pain, and were significantly more disabled than centralizers, who instead had more severe degenerative findings on MRI. Thus, classification to non-centralizers by the McKenzie method seems not predict higher incidence of degenerative findings on MRI compared to centralizers.","Objective

Cluster analysis of spatio-temporal event-related potential (ERP) data is a promising tool for exploring the measurement time window of ERPs. However, even after preprocessing, the remaining noise can result in uncertain cluster maps followed by unreliable time windows while clustering via conventional clustering methods.

Methods
We designed an ensemble deep clustering pipeline to determine a reliable time window for the ERP of interest from temporal concatenated grand average ERP data. The proposed pipeline includes semi-supervised deep clustering methods initialized by consensus clustering and unsupervised deep clustering methods with end-to-end architectures. Ensemble clustering from those deep clusterings was used by the designed adaptive time window determination to estimate the time window.

Results
After applying simulated and real ERP data, our method successfully obtained the time window for identifying the P3 components (as the interest of both ERP studies) while additional noise (e.g., adding 20 dB to −5 dB white Gaussian noise) was added to the prepared data.

Conclusion
Compared to the state-of-the-art clustering methods, a superior clustering performance was yielded from both ERP data. Furthermore, more stable and precise time windows were elicited as the noise increased.

Significance
Our study provides a complementary understanding of identifying the cognitive process using deep clustering analysis to the existing studies. Our finding suggests that deep clustering can be used to identify the ERP of interest when the data is imperfect after preprocessing.","Objective

Pain can have a significant impact on an individual's life, as it has both cognitive and affective consequences. However, our understanding of how pain affects social cognition is limited. Previous studies have shown that pain, as an alarm stimulus, can disrupt cognitive processing when focal attention is required, but whether pain also affects task-irrelevant perceptual processing is unclear.

Methods
We examined the effect of laboratory-induced pain on event-related potentials (ERPs) to neutral, sad, and happy faces before, during, and after a cold pressor pain. ERPs reflecting different stages of visual processing (P1, N170, and P2) were analyzed.

Results
Pain decreased the P1 amplitude for happy faces and increased the N170 amplitude for happy and sad faces compared to the pre-pain phase. The effect of pain on N170 was also observed in the post-pain phase. The P2 component was not affected by pain.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that pain alters both featural (P1) and structural face-sensitive (N170) visual encoding of emotional faces, even when the faces are irrelevant to the task. While the effect of pain on initial feature encoding seemed to be disruptive and specific to happy faces, later processing stages showed long-lasting and increased activity for both sad and happy emotional faces.

Significance
The observed alterations in face perception due to pain may have consequences for real-life interactions, as fast and automatic encoding of facial emotions is important for social interactions.","Background

Thus, we studied if respiration and cardiac cycle phases at burst stimulation onset affect hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA3–CA1 synapse in urethane-anesthetized adult male Sprague–Dawley rats. In a between-subjects design, we timed burst stimulation of the ventral hippocampal commissure (vHC) to systole or diastole either during expiration or inspiration and recorded responses throughout the hippocampus with a linear probe. As classical conditioning in humans seems to be most efficient at expiration-diastole, we also expected LTP to be most efficient if burst stimulation was targeted to expiration-diastole. However, LTP was induced equally in all four groups and respiration and cardiac cycle phase did not modulate CA1 responses to vHC stimulation overall.

The arousal state of humans and other mammals varies according to the circadian rhythm regulated by light. In humans, nightly sleep stages repeat in a cyclic manner so that non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep is more common first and REM sleep is more common towards the morning. Compared to awake state, sleep improves memory consolidation. During non-REM sleep, neuronal activation patterns formed during awake experience repeat in the brain. This process is thought to reflect the consolidation of information into long-term memory in distributed neural networks in the neocortex and sub-cortical structures like the thalamus and the hippocampus. The role of REM sleep in this systemic-level mechanism of memory consolidation is still unclear. REM sleep appears important for learning as its amount and proportion increases after learning and is reflected in the memory performance quantified after sleep. Sleep strengthens the consolidation of both procedural and declarative memory traces. It is also possible that one can learn about stimuli presented during sleep, and reminders of previous learning presented during sleep improve memory consolidation. The role of sleep in learning and memory is thus crucial and sleep can be utilized in improving learning.","Muu neurotiede"

The present study investigates whether sustained attention is required for the dimension-based RCB by inserting interference or interruption between the retro-cue and the test array to distract attention. We tested the effects of perceptual interference or cognitive interruption on dimension-based RCB when the interference (Experiments 1 and 2 with masks) or interruption (Experiments 3 and 4 with an odd-even task) occurred concurrently with the stages for the maintenance of prioritized information (long cue-and-interference/interruption interstimulus interval, e.g., Experiments 1 and 3) or the deployment of attention (short cue-and-interference/interruption interstimulus interval, e.g., Experiments 2 and 4). Our results demonstrate that perceptual interference or cognitive interruption attenuates the dimension-based RCB. These findings suggest that sustained attention is necessary for the effective prioritization of a specific dimension of VWM representations.","In visual working memory (VWM) tasks, participants’ performances can be improved through the use of dimension-based retro-cues, which direct internal attention to prioritize a particular dimension (e.g., color or orientation) of VWM representations even after the stimuli disappear.

However, it is not known how the motor control is organized, how the H-reflex and V-wave responses modulate and how repeatable these are during dynamic balance perturbations. To assess the repeatability, 16 participants (8 men, 8 women) went through two, identical measurement sessions with ~ 48 h intervals, where maximal isometric plantar flexion (IMVC) and dynamic balance perturbations in horizontal, anterior–posterior direction were performed. Soleus muscle (SOL) neural modulation during balance perturbations were measured at 40, 70, 100 and 130 ms after ankle movement by using both H-reflex and V-wave methods. V-wave, which depicts the magnitude of efferent motoneuronal output (Bergmann et al. in JAMA 8:e77705, 2013), was significantly enhanced as early as 70 ms after the ankle movement. Both the ratio of M-wave-normalized V-wave (0.022–0.076, p < 0.001) and H-reflex (0.386–0.523, p < 0.001) increased significantly at the latency of 70 ms compared to the latency of 40 ms and remained at these levels at latter latencies. In addition, M-wave normalized V-wave/H-reflex ratio increased from 0.056 to 0.179 (p < 0.001). The repeatability of V-wave demonstrated moderate-to-substantial repeatability (ICC = 0.774–0.912) whereas the H-reflex was more variable showing fair-to-substantial repeatability (ICC = 0.581–0.855). As a conclusion, V-wave was enhanced already at 70 ms after the perturbation, which may indicate that increased activation of motoneurons occurred due to changes in descending drive.

Objective: To examine neurobiological, psychosocial, and behavioral mechanisms that mediate associations of physical activity with psychiatric symptoms in youth by testing an integrated model.
Design, setting, and participants: Generation R is an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study collecting data from fetal life until young adulthood in a multiethnic urban population in the Netherlands. Pregnant women living in Rotterdam with an expected delivery date between April 2002 and January 2006 were eligible for participation along with their children born during this time. Data were collected at a single research center in the Erasmus Medical Center Sophia Children’s Hospital. For the current study, data were analyzed from 4216 children with complete data on both exposure and outcome at ages 6, 10, and 13 years. Data were analyzed from January 2021 to November 2022.
Exposures: Physical activity was ascertained at age 6 years (visit 1) via parent report and included weekly frequency and duration of walking or cycling to or from school, physical education at school, outdoor play, swimming, and sports participation.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Psychiatric symptoms (internalizing and externalizing symptoms) were assessed at age 6 years (visit 1) and at age 13 years (visit 3) using the Child Behavior Checklist. Several mechanisms were explored as mediators, measured at age 10 years (visit 2). Neurobiological mechanisms included total brain volume, white matter microstructure, and resting-state connectivity assessed using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Psychosocial mechanisms included self-esteem, body image, and friendship. Behavioral mechanisms included sleep quality, diet quality, and recreational screen time. Pearson correlations between physical activity measures and psychiatric symptoms were calculated, with false discovery rate correction applied to account for the number of tests performed. Mediation analyses were performed when a correlation (defined as false discovery rate P < .05) between exposure and outcome was observed and were adjusted for confounders.
Results: Among the 4216 children included in this study, the mean (SD) age was 6.0 (0.4) years at visit 1, and 2115 participants (50.2%) were girls. More sports participation was associated with fewer internalizing symptoms (β for direct effect, −0.025; SE, 0.078; P = .03) but not externalizing symptoms. Self-esteem mediated the association between sports participation and internalizing symptoms (β for indirect effect, −0.009; SE, 0.018; P = .002). No evidence was found for associations between any other neurobiological, psychosocial, or behavioral variables. No association was found between other types of physical activity and psychiatric symptoms at these ages.
Conclusions and Relevance: The integrated model presented in this cohort study evaluated potential mechanisms mediating associations between physical activity and psychiatric symptoms in youth. Self-esteem mediated an association between sports participation in childhood and internalizing symptoms in adolescence; other significant mediations were not observed. Further studies might explore whether larger effects are present in certain subgroups (eg, children at high risk of developing psychiatric symptoms), different ages, or structured sport-based physical activity interventions.","Importance: Understanding the mechanisms by which physical activity is associated with a lower risk of psychiatric symptoms may stimulate the identification of cost-efficient strategies for preventing and treating mental illness at early life stages.

Results: Among the 4216 children included in this study, the mean (SD) age was 6.0 (0.4) years at visit 1, and 2115 participants (50.2%) were girls. More sports participation was associated with fewer internalizing symptoms (β for direct effect, −0.025; SE, 0.078; P = .03) but not externalizing symptoms. Self-esteem mediated the association between sports participation and internalizing symptoms (β for indirect effect, −0.009; SE, 0.018; P = .002). No evidence was found for associations between any other neurobiological, psychosocial, or behavioral variables. No association was found between other types of physical activity and psychiatric symptoms at these ages.
Conclusions and Relevance: The integrated model presented in this cohort study evaluated potential mechanisms mediating associations between physical activity and psychiatric symptoms in youth. Self-esteem mediated an association between sports participation in childhood and internalizing symptoms in adolescence; other significant mediations were not observed. Further studies might explore whether larger effects are present in certain subgroups (eg, children at high risk of developing psychiatric symptoms), different ages, or structured sport-based physical activity interventions.","Magneettikuvaus"

Manual detection of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a challenging task for many reasons such as time-consuming and subjective. This study aimed to develop a deep learning model for automatically detecting abnormal sleep respiratory episodes in patients with OSA and to explore the performance differences between different sleep centers and different kind of sleep monitoring devices. Methods. The proposed model which comprised branch convolution, separable convolution, and self-attention mechanisms, took minute-to-minute raw electroencephalography (EEG) and oral-nasal airflow signals as its input. Results. The results of five-fold cross-validation in 50 clinical polysomnography recordings evidenced that the average accuracy was 0.877, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.837, and 0.873, respectively. The proposed method achieved almost perfect agreement with manual scoring method according to the apnea-hypopnea index. In addition, experiments revealed that the combination of EEG and oral-nasal airflow signals could improve the accuracy of approximately 10% relative to oral-nasal airflow signals.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are believed to have the most therapeutic potential for neurological disorders because they can differentiate into various neurons and glial cells. This research evaluated the safety and efficacy of intranasal administration of NSCs in children with cerebral palsy (CP). The functional brain network (FBN) analysis based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis based on T1-weighted images were performed to evaluate functional and structural changes in the brain.

Methods
A total of 25 CP patients aged 3–12 years were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 15), which received an intranasal infusion of NSCs loaded with nasal patches and rehabilitation therapy, or the control group (n = 10) received rehabilitation therapy only. The primary endpoints were the safety (assessed by the incidence of adverse events (AEs), laboratory and imaging examinations) and the changes in the Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88), the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale, the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), and some adapted scales. The secondary endpoints were the FBN and VBM analysis.

Results
There were only four AEs happened during the 24-month follow-up period. There was no significant difference in the laboratory examinations before and after treatment, and the magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormal nasal and intracranial masses. Compared to the control group, patients in the treatment group showed apparent improvements in GMFM-88 and ADL 24 months after treatment. Compared with the baseline, the scale scores of the Fine Motor Function, Sociability, Life Adaptability, Expressive Ability, GMFM-88, and ADL increased significantly in the treatment group 24 months after treatment, while the SDSC score decreased considerably. Compared with baseline, the FBN analysis showed a substantial decrease in brain network energy, and the VBM analysis showed a significant increase in gray matter volume in the treatment group after NSCs treatment.

Conclusions
Our results showed that intranasal administration of NSCs was well-tolerated and potentially beneficial in children with CP.","Background

Proprioceptive responses in the primary sensorimotor (SM1) cortex can be elicited by stimulating the proprioceptors using evoked (passive) limb movements. In magnetoencephalography (MEG), proprioceptive processing can be quantified by recording the movement evoked fields (MEFs) and movement-induced beta power modulations or by computing corticokinematic coherence (CKC) between the limb kinematics and cortical activity. We examined whether cortical proprioceptive processing quantified with MEF peak strength, relative beta suppression and rebound power and CKC strength is affected by the movement range of the finger.

MEG activity was measured from 16 right-handed healthy volunteers while movements were applied to their right-index finger metacarpophalangeal joint with an actuator. Movements were either intermittent, every 3000 ± 250 ms, to estimate MEF or continuous, at 3 Hz, to estimate CKC. In both cases, 4 different ranges of motion of the stimuli were investigated: 15, 18, 22 and 26 mm for MEF and 6, 7, 9 and 13 mm for CKC. MEF amplitude, relative beta suppression and rebound as well as peak CKC strength at the movement frequency were compared between the movement ranges in the source space. Inter-individual variation was also compared between the MEF and CKC strengths.

As expected, MEF and CKC responses peaked at the contralateral SM1 cortex. MEF peak, beta suppression and rebound and CKC strengths were similar across all movement ranges. Furthermore, CKC strength showed a lower degree of inter-individual variation compared with MEF strength.

Our result of absent modulation by movement range in cortical responses to passive movements of the finger indicates that variability in movement range should not hinder comparability between different studies or participants. Furthermore, our data indicates that CKC is less prone to inter-individual variability than MEFs, and thus more advantageous in what pertains to statistical power.","Proprioception is the sense of body position and movement that relies on afference from the proprioceptors in muscles and joints.

Although channel selection has been utilized in seizure prediction and detection studies, most of them focus on the combination with conventional machine learning methods. Thus, channel selection combined with deep learning methods can be further analyzed in the field of seizure prediction. Given this, in this work, a novel iEEG-based deep learning method of One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) combined with channel increment strategy was proposed for the effective seizure prediction. First, we used 4-sec sliding windows without overlap to segment iEEG signals. Then, 4-sec iEEG segments with an increasing number of channels (channel increment strategy, from one channel to all channels) were sequentially fed into the constructed 1D-CNN model. Next, the patient-specific model was trained for classification. Finally, according to the classification results in different channel cases, the channel case with the best classification rate was selected for each patient. Our method was tested on the Freiburg iEEG database, and the system performances were evaluated at two levels (segment- and event-based levels). Two model training strategies (Strategy-1 and Strategy-2) based on the K-fold cross validation (K-CV) were discussed in our work. (1) For the Strategy-1, a basic K-CV, a sensitivity of 90.18%, specificity of 94.81%, and accuracy of 94.42% were achieved at the segment-based level. At the event-based level, an event-based sensitivity of 100%, and false prediction rate (FPR) of 0.12/h were attained. (2) For the Strategy-2, the difference from the Strategy-1 is that a trained model selection step is added during model training. We obtained a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 86.23%, 96.00% and 95.13% respectively at the segment-based level. At the event-based level, we achieved an event-based sensitivity of 98.65% with 0.08/h FPR. Our method also showed a better performance in seizure prediction compared to many previous studies and the random predictor using the same database.

Next, the patient-specific model was trained for classification. Finally, according to the classification results in different channel cases, the channel case with the best classification rate was selected for each patient. Our method was tested on the Freiburg iEEG database, and the system performances were evaluated at two levels (segment- and event-based levels). Two model training strategies (Strategy-1 and Strategy-2) based on the K-fold cross validation (K-CV) were discussed in our work. (1) For the Strategy-1, a basic K-CV, a sensitivity of 90.18%, specificity of 94.81%, and accuracy of 94.42% were achieved at the segment-based level. At the event-based level, an event-based sensitivity of 100%, and false prediction rate (FPR) of 0.12/h were attained. (2) For the Strategy-2, the difference from the Strategy-1 is that a trained model selection step is added during model training. We obtained a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 86.23%, 96.00% and 95.13% respectively at the segment-based level. At the event-based level, we achieved an event-based sensitivity of 98.65% with 0.08/h FPR. Our method also showed a better performance in seizure prediction compared to many previous studies and the random predictor using the same database. This may have reference value for the future clinical application of seizure prediction.","EEG"

To meet this clinical demand, we present an encoder–decoder deep learning architecture which employs an EfficientNet encoder in the UNet++ architecture (E-UNet++). EfficientNet helps in effectively encoding multiscale image features. The nested decoders with skip connections aggregate multiscale features from low-level to high-level, which helps in detecting fine-grained details. A cohort of 228 cervical cancer patients with multimodal MRI sequences, including T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient imaging, contrast enhancement T1-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE), has been explored. Evaluations are performed by considering either single or multimodal MRI with standard segmentation quantitative metrics: dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IOU), and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD). Our results show that the E-UNet++ model can achieve DSC values of 0.681–0.786, IOU values of 0.558–0.678, and 95% HD values of 3.779–7.411 pixels in different single sequences. Meanwhile, it provides DSC values of 0.644 and 0.687 on three DCE subsequences and all MRI sequences together. Our designed model is superior to other comparative models, which shows the potential to be used as an artificial intelligence tool for cervical cancer segmentation in multimodal MRI.","Magneettikuvaus"

Exercise might potentially attenuate these adverse consequences.

Objectives  To investigate the effects of an exercise program on brain health indicators, including intelligence, executive function, academic performance, and brain outcomes, among children with overweight or obesity and to explore potential mediators and moderators of the main effects of exercise.

Design, Setting, and Participants  All preexercise and postexercise data for this 20-week randomized clinical trial of 109 children aged 8 to 11 years with overweight or obesity were collected from November 21, 2014, to June 30, 2016, with neuroimaging data processing and analyses conducted between June 1, 2017, and December 20, 2021. All 109 children were included in the intention-to-treat analyses; 90 children (82.6%) completed the postexercise evaluation and attended 70% or more of the recommended exercise sessions and were included in per-protocol analyses.

Interventions  All participants received lifestyle recommendations. The control group continued their usual routines, whereas the exercise group attended a minimum of 3 supervised 90-minute sessions per week in an out-of-school setting.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Intelligence, executive function (cognitive flexibility, inhibition, and working memory), and academic performance were assessed with standardized tests, and hippocampal volume was measured with magnetic resonance imaging.

Results  The 109 participants included 45 girls (41.3%); participants had a mean (SD) body mass index of 26.8 (3.6) and a mean (SD) age of 10.0 (1.1) years at baseline. In per-protocol analyses, the exercise intervention improved crystallized intelligence, with the exercise group improving from before exercise to after exercise (mean z score, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.44-0.80]) compared with the control group (mean z score, –0.10 [95% CI, –0.28 to 0.09]; difference between groups, 0.72 SDs [95% CI, 0.46-0.97]; P < .001). Total intelligence also improved significantly more in the exercise group (mean z score, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.48-0.89]) than in the control group (mean z score, 0.07 [95% CI, –0.14 to 0.28]; difference between groups, 0.62 SDs [95% CI, 0.31-0.91]; P < .001). Exercise also positively affected a composite score of cognitive flexibility (mean z score: exercise group, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.05-0.44]; control group, –0.17 [95% CI, –0.39 to 0.04]; difference between groups, 0.42 SDs [95% CI, 0.13-0.71]; P = .005). These main effects were consistent in intention-to-treat analyses and after multiple-testing correction. There was a positive, small-magnitude effect of exercise on total academic performance (mean z score: exercise group, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.18-0.44]; control group, 0.10 [95% CI, –0.04 to 0.24]; difference between groups, 0.21 SDs [95% CI, 0.01-0.40]; P = .03), which was partially mediated by cognitive flexibility. Inhibition, working memory, hippocampal volume, and other brain magnetic resonance imaging outcomes studied were not affected by the exercise program. The intervention increased cardiorespiratory fitness performance as indicated by longer treadmill time to exhaustion (mean z score: exercise group, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.27-0.82]; control group, 0.13 [95% CI, –0.16 to 0.41]; difference between groups, 0.42 SDs [95% CI, 0.01-0.82]; P = .04), and these changes in fitness mediated some of the effects (small percentage of mediation [approximately 10%-20%]). The effects of exercise were overall consistent across the moderators tested, except for larger improvements in intelligence among boys compared with girls.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this randomized clinical trial, exercise positively affected intelligence and cognitive flexibility during development among children with overweight or obesity. However, the structural and functional brain changes responsible for these improvements were not identified.

Excess abdominal fat is a major determinant in the development of insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders. Increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) seems to precede the development of insulin resistance and is therefore a prime target of childhood lifestyle interventions aimed at preventing diabetes.

Objectives  
To examine the effect of added exercise to a family-based lifestyle intervention program designed to reduce VAT plus subcutaneous (ASAT), intermuscular (IMAAT), and pancreatic (PAT) adipose tissue in children with overweight or obesity and to explore the effect of changes in VAT on insulin resistance.

Design, Setting, and Participants  
This 2-group, parallel-design clinical trial was conducted in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. A total of 116 children with overweight or obesity participated and were assigned to a 22-week family-based lifestyle program (control group [n = 57]) or the same program plus an exercise intervention (exercise group [n = 59]). Data were collected between September 1, 2014, and June 30, 2017, and imaging processing for fat depot assessments and data analysis were performed between May 1, 2019, and February 12, 2021.

Interventions  
The compared interventions consisted of a family-based lifestyle and psychoeducation program (two 90-minute sessions per month) and the same program plus supervised exercise (three 90-minute sessions per week).

Main Outcomes and Measures  
The primary outcome of this study was the change in VAT between baseline and 22 weeks as estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. The secondary outcomes were changes in ASAT, IMAAT, and PAT. The effect of changes in VAT area on insulin resistance was also recorded.

Results  
The 116 participants included in the analysis (62 girls [53.4%]) had a mean (SD) age of 10.6 (1.1) years, and 67 (57.8%) presented with obesity. Significantly greater reductions were recorded for the exercise group in terms of reduction in VAT (−18.1% vs −8.5% for the control group; P = .004), ASAT (−9.9% vs −3.0%; P = .001), and IMAAT (−6.0% vs −2.6%; P = .02) fat fractions compared with the control group. Changes in VAT explained 87.6% of the improvement seen in insulin resistance (β = −0.102 [95% CI, −0.230 to −0.002]).

Conclusions and Relevance  
These findings suggest that the addition of exercise to a lifestyle intervention program substantially enhanced the positive effects on abdominal fat depots in children with overweight or obesity. In addition, the reduction in VAT seemed to largely mediate the improvement of insulin sensitivity. These results highlight the importance of including exercise as part of lifestyle therapies aimed at treating childhood obesity and preventing the development of type 2 diabetes.","Importance  
Excess abdominal fat is a major determinant in the development of insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders. Increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) seems to precede the development of insulin resistance and is therefore a prime target of childhood lifestyle interventions aimed at preventing diabetes.

Objectives  
To examine the effect of added exercise to a family-based lifestyle intervention program designed to reduce VAT plus subcutaneous (ASAT), intermuscular (IMAAT), and pancreatic (PAT) adipose tissue in children with overweight or obesity and to explore the effect of changes in VAT on insulin resistance.

Design, Setting, and Participants  
This 2-group, parallel-design clinical trial was conducted in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. A total of 116 children with overweight or obesity participated and were assigned to a 22-week family-based lifestyle program (control group [n = 57]) or the same program plus an exercise intervention (exercise group [n = 59]). Data were collected between September 1, 2014, and June 30, 2017, and imaging processing for fat depot assessments and data analysis were performed between May 1, 2019, and February 12, 2021.

The compared interventions consisted of a family-based lifestyle and psychoeducation program (two 90-minute sessions per month) and the same program plus supervised exercise (three 90-minute sessions per week).

Both obesity and SDB have been separately associated with poorer brain health, yet whether SDB severity affects brain health in children with obesity remains unanswered. This study aimed to examine associations of SDB severity with academic performance and brain structure (i.e., total brain and gray and white matter volumes and gray matter volume in the hippocampus) in children with overweight/obesity. One hundred nine children aged 8–12 years with overweight/obesity were included. SDB severity and its subscales (i.e., snoring, daytime sleepiness, and inattention/hyperactivity) were evaluated via the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), and academic performance was evaluated with the Woodcock-Muñoz standardized test and school grades. Brain structure was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. SDB severity was not associated with academic performance measured by the standardized test (all |β|> 0.160, P > 0.076), yet it was associated with the school grade point average (β = -0.226, P = 0.007) and natural and social science grades (β = -0.269, P = 0.024). Intention/hyperactivity seemed to drive these associations. No associations were found between SDB severity and the remaining school grades (all β < -0.188, P > 0.065) or brain volumes (all P > 0.05).

Conclusion: Our study shows that SDB severity was associated with lower school grades, yet it was not associated with the standardized measurement of academic performance or with brain volumes in children with overweight/obesity. SDB severity may add to academic problems in children beyond the effects contributed by overweight/obesity status alone.","Approximately 4–11% of children suffer from sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and children with obesity are at increased risk.

Only recently, the use of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) has received much attention, especially for face or music recognition, but neuro-engineering research into this new approach has not been carried out yet. The aim of this study was to provide a variety of reliable ERP markers of visual and auditory perception for the development of new and more complex mind-reading systems for reconstructing the mental content from brain activity.

Methods: A total of 30 participants were shown 280 color pictures (adult, infant, and animal faces; human bodies; written words; checkerboards; and objects) and 120 auditory files (speech, music, and affective vocalizations). This paradigm did not involve target selection to avoid artifactual waves linked to decision-making and response preparation (e.g., P300 and motor potentials), masking the neural signature of semantic representation. Overall, 12,000 ERP waveforms × 126 electrode channels (1 million 512,000 ERP waveforms) were processed and artifact-rejected.

Results: Clear and distinct category-dependent markers of perceptual and cognitive processing were identified through statistical analyses, some of which were novel to the literature.

Conclusion: The data showed a high level of accuracy (p ≤ 0.01) in the discriminating the perceptual categories eliciting the various electrical potentials by statistical analyses.

In this study, we evaluate two different pipelines for removing ocular artifacts from MEG data collected during continuous, naturalistic reading, with the focus on saccades and blinks. Both pipeline alternatives are based on blind source separation methods but differ fundamentally in their approach. The first alternative is a multi-part process, in which saccades are first extracted by applying Second-Order Blind Identification (SOBI) and, subsequently, FastICA is used to extract blinks. The other alternative uses a single powerful method, Adaptive Mixture ICA (AMICA), to remove all artifact types at once.

Both pipelines performed well, extracting the artifacts in a single component per artifact type in most subjects.

The results were largely similar for the two pipelines, with the exception that SOBI-FastICA reduced signal in the right frontal cortex in all studied frequency bands more than AMICA. However, there was considerable interindividual variation in the effects of the pipelines.

This study aimed to explore the functional connectivity (FC) and topological properties among whole brain networks and correlations with impaired cognition and distinguish T2DM from healthy controls (HC) to identify potential biomarkers for cognition abnormalities.

Methods: A total of 80 T2DM and 55 well-matched HC were recruited in this study. Subjects’ clinical data, neuropsychological tests and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired. Whole-brain network FC were mapped, the topological characteristics were analyzed using a graph-theoretic approach, the FC and topological characteristics of the network were compared between T2DM and HC using a general linear model, and correlations between networks and clinical and cognitive characteristics were identified. The support vector machine (SVM) model was used to identify differences between T2DM and HC.

Results: In patients with T2DM, FC was higher in two core regions [precuneus/posterior cingulated cortex (PCC)_1 and later prefrontal cortex_1] in the default mode network and lower in bilateral superior parietal lobes (within dorsal attention network), and decreased between the right medial frontal cortex and left auditory cortex. The FC of the right frontal medial-left auditory cortex was positively correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scales and negatively correlated with the blood glucose levels. Long-range connectivity between bilateral auditory cortex was missing in the T2DM. The nodal degree centrality and efficiency of PCC were higher in T2DM than in HC (P < 0.005). The nodal degree centrality in the PCC in the SVM model was 97.56% accurate in distinguishing T2DM patients from HC, demonstrating the reliability of the prediction model.

Conclusion: Functional abnormalities in the auditory cortex in T2DM may be related to cognitive impairment, such as memory and attention, and nodal degree centrality in the PCC might serve as a potential neuroimaging biomarker to predict and identify T2DM.","Objective: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a high risk of cognitive decline and dementia, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet clearly understood.

Firstly, MSE with sliding window is implemented to extract the EEG features to determine the distraction position. Statistical analysis of vehicle behavioral data is then performed to validate driving performance indeed changes around distraction position. Finally, we use BiLSTM to detect driver distraction with MSE and other traditional features. Our results show that MSE notably decreases after distraction. Consistent with the result of MSE, driving performance significantly deviates from the normal state after distraction. Besides, BiLSTM performance of MSE outperforms other entropy-based methods and is better than behavioral features. Additionally, the accuracy is improved again after adding MSE feature to behavioral features with a 3% increasement.

Nineteen healthy volunteers (18 right-foot dominant, 36.1 ± 6.6 yr, 7 females) were measured in two MEG sessions separated by 9 ± 5 days in which their right ankle was rotated intermittently using a pneumatic movement actuator (160 stimuli, 3000 ± 250 ms interstimulus interval) to elicit evoked fields and induced responses.

Peak induced response amplitudes were analyzed from the peak gradiometer demonstrating the most robust beta suppression and beta rebound. The between session reproducibility was estimated using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC).

Evoked field amplitudes, beta suppression and beta rebound amplitudes all demonstrated a large inter-individual variation but excellent between session reproducibility (ICC >0.81). Kinematics of the proprioceptive stimuli were stable and did not correlate with MEG response strengths.

Clinical Relevance―Analysis of cortical spatiotemporal representations to electrotactile stimulation can potentially be used for tailoring optimal sensory feedback delivery in patients with sensorimotor impairments.","MEG"

This chapter helps educators to rethink and redefine the role and meaning of technology in education broadly speaking, and describes how the use of digital technologies in the acquisition of basic skills like reading and writing specifically impacts learning from an embodied perspective. Drawing on examples from Nordic school contexts, we illustrate how 4E cognition can be pursued to benefit the learning experience in our digital age.

For us, as human beings, the skills of reading and writing are not innate — meaning, there is no genetic blueprint for reading or writing (Wolf et al., 2012). Whereas children normally develop the ability to speak and communicate by means of language socialization, both reading and writing require systematic training over an extended period of time to develop. Helping children learn to read and write is one of the major tasks of basic education. A recent study using functional magnetic resonance imaging found that both reading and writing are multisensory experiences (Smith et al., 2018). Yet the ongoing digitalization poses new challenges for researchers and schools concerned with students’ literacy skills. As advances in technology in classroom applications become more mainstream, the way in which children engage in reading and writing is changing. Therefore, we argue that the theory of embodied cognition (4E) should be acknowledged when considering the strengths and weaknesses of various technologies in supporting different aspects of reading (e.g., low-level processes such as letter-sound correspondences, and high-level processes such as inference-based comprehension skills) and writing.","The insights emerging from embodied (or 4E) cognition (Newen, et al., 2018) hold considerable promise for education, but thus far have had little impact.

Opening of the disciplinary boundaries both at theoretical and methodological domains enables to increase discussion between researchers from different disciplines.","This chapter introduces methods for using an individual-level multimodal approach for studying the learning experience within the context of vocational education.

Long-term sports training, such as skill and endurance training, leads to specific neuroplasticity. However, it remains unclear if muscle stretch-induced proprioceptive feedback influences corticospinal facilitation/inhibition differently between skill- and endurance-trained athletes. This study investigated modulation of corticospinal excitability following rapid ankle dorsiflexion between well-trained skill and endurance athletes.

Methods
Ten skill- and ten endurance-trained athletes participated in the study. Corticospinal excitability was tested by single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) at three different latencies following passive rapid ankle dorsiflexion. Motor evoked potential (MEP), short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and long-latency intracortical inhibition (LICI) were recorded by surface electromyography from the soleus muscle.

Results
Compared to immediately before ankle dorsiflexion (Onset), TMS induced significantly greater MEPs during the supraspinal reaction period (~ 120 ms after short-latency reflex, SLR) in the skill group only (from 1.7 ± 1.0 to 2.7 ± 1.8%M-max, P = 0.005) despite both conditions being passive. ICF was significantly greater over all latencies in skill than endurance athletes (F (3, 45) = 4.64, P = 0.007), although no between-group differences for stimulations at specific latencies (e.g., at SLR) were observed.

Conclusion
The skill group showed higher corticospinal excitability during the supraspinal reaction phase, which may indicate a “priming” of corticospinal excitability following rapid ankle dorsiflexion for a supraspinal reaction post-stretch, which appears absent in endurance-trained athletes.","Purpose
Long-term sports training, such as skill and endurance training, leads to specific neuroplasticity. However, it remains unclear if muscle stretch-induced proprioceptive feedback influences corticospinal facilitation/inhibition differently between skill- and endurance-trained athletes. This study investigated modulation of corticospinal excitability following rapid ankle dorsiflexion between well-trained skill and endurance athletes.

Methods
Ten skill- and ten endurance-trained athletes participated in the study. Corticospinal excitability was tested by single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) at three different latencies following passive rapid ankle dorsiflexion. Motor evoked potential (MEP), short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and long-latency intracortical inhibition (LICI) were recorded by surface electromyography from the soleus muscle.

Results
Compared to immediately before ankle dorsiflexion (Onset), TMS induced significantly greater MEPs during the supraspinal reaction period (~ 120 ms after short-latency reflex, SLR) in the skill group only (from 1.7 ± 1.0 to 2.7 ± 1.8%M-max, P = 0.005) despite both conditions being passive. ICF was significantly greater over all latencies in skill than endurance athletes (F (3, 45) = 4.64, P = 0.007), although no between-group differences for stimulations at specific latencies (e.g., at SLR) were observed.

Conclusion
The skill group showed higher corticospinal excitability during the supraspinal reaction phase, which may indicate a “priming” of corticospinal excitability following rapid ankle dorsiflexion for a supraspinal reaction post-stretch, which appears absent in endurance-trained athletes.","Aivojen magneettistimulaatio"

The visual working memory is a limited workspace where information can be saved online and can be accessed and operated by advanced cognitive function during the maintenance period. A large number of behavioral and electrophysiological studies have shown that there are differences in visual working memory performance of different emotional faces. Specifically, angry faces can enhance the visual working memory performance; fearful faces may cause some damage to visual working memory; sad faces will impair face recognition encoding in visual working memory. However, the visual working memory of happy emotional faces is mainly reflected in the choice of attention compared with other emotional faces, and the time is slightly delayed compared with that of angry faces. This paper sorts out the relevant research on the differences in visual working memory performance produced by different emotional faces as stimuli, and tries to summarize the possible reasons for these differences.","","Muu neurotiede"

To develop a high temporal resolution functional MRI method for tracking repeating events in the brain.

Methods
We developed a novel functional MRI method using multiband sweep imaging with Fourier transformation (SWIFT), termed event-recurring SWIFT (EVER-SWIFT). The method is able to image similar repeating events with subsecond temporal resolution. Here, we demonstrate the use of EVER-SWIFT for detecting functional MRI responses during deep brain stimulation of the medial septal nucleus and during spontaneous isoflurane-induced burst suppression in the rat brain at 9.4 T with 200-ms temporal resolution.

Results
The EVER-SWIFT approach showed that the shapes and time-to-peak values of the response curves to deep brain stimulation significantly differed between downstream brain regions connected to the medial septal nucleus, resembling findings obtained with traditional 2-second temporal resolution. In contrast, EVER-SWIFT allowed for detailed temporal measurement of a spontaneous isoflurane-induced bursting activity pattern, which was not achieved with traditional temporal resolution.

Conclusion
The EVER-SWIFT technique enables subsecond 3D imaging of both stimulated and spontaneously recurring brain activities, and thus holds great potential for studying the mechanisms of neuromodulation and spontaneous brain activity.","Purpose

Animal and human cross-sectional data suggest that bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) may respond to mechanical loads and exercise. We conducted the first randomised controlled trial of exercise on MAT modulations in humans.

Methods
Forty patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (NSCLBP) were enrolled in a six-month single-blinded randomised controlled trial (ACTRN12615001270505). Twenty patients loaded their spines via progressive upright aerobic and resistance exercises targeting major muscle groups (Exercise). Twenty patients performed non-weightbearing motor control training and manual therapy (Control). Testing occurred at baseline, 3-months (3mo) and 6-months (6mo). Lumbar vertebral fat fraction (VFF) was measured using magnetic resonance imaging axial mDixon sequences.

Results
When compared to baseline (percent change), lumbar vertebral fat fraction (VFF; measured using magnetic resonance imaging axial mDixon sequences) was lower in Exercise at 3mo at L2 (−3.7[6.8]%, p = 0.033) and L4 (−2.6[4.1]%, p = 0.015), but not in Control. There were no between-group effects. The effects of Exercise on VFF were sex-specific, with VFF lower in men at L2, L3, L4 at 3mo and at L1, L2, L3 and L4 at 6mo (p all ≤ 0.05), but not in women. Leg and trunk lean mass were increased at 3mo in Exercise. Changes in VFF correlated significantly with changes in total fat (ρ = 0.40) and lean (ρ = −0.41) masses, but not with lumbar BMD (ρ = −0.10) or visceral adipose tissue volume (ρ = 0.23).

Conclusions
This trial provided first prospective evidence in humans that a moderate exercise intervention may modulate lumbar VFF as a surrogate measure of MAT at 3mo, yet not 6mo. The effect of exercise on MAT may be more prominent in males than females.","Background

Here, we used the biophysical modelling software Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN) whose foundation is a canonical neocortical circuit model to interpret the cell and network mechanisms contributing to macroscale AEFs elicited by a simple tone, measured with magnetoencephalography. We found that AEFs can be reproduced by activating the neocortical circuit through a layer specific sequence of feedforward and feedback excitatory synaptic drives, similar to prior simulation of somatosensory evoked responses, supporting the notion that basic structures and activation patterns are preserved across sensory regions.

It possesses superior spatiotemporal resolution compared to the surgical, electrical, and pharmacological methods traditionally used in studying brain function. A multitude of optogenetic tools for neuroscience have been created that, for example, enable the control of action potential generation via light-activated ion channels. Other optogenetic proteins have been used in the brain, for example, to control long-term potentiation or to ablate specific subtypes of neurons. In in vivo applications, however, the majority of optogenetic tools are operated with blue, green, or yellow light, which all have limited penetration in biological tissues compared to red light and especially infrared light.

It possesses superior spatiotemporal resolution compared to the surgical, electrical, and pharmacological methods traditionally used in studying brain function. A multitude of optogenetic tools for neuroscience have been created that, for example, enable the control of action potential generation via light-activated ion channels. Other optogenetic proteins have been used in the brain, for example, to control long-term potentiation or to ablate specific subtypes of neurons. In in vivo applications, however, the majority of optogenetic tools are operated with blue, green, or yellow light, which all have limited penetration in biological tissues compared to red light and especially infrared light.

This narrative review comprehensively summarizes behavioral, neuroimaging, and neuroelectric findings associated with chronic physical activity and fitness on brain and cognition in childhood obesity. Based on the literature reviewed, increased adiposity has a demonstrated relationship with neurocognitive health via mechanisms triggered by central inflammation and insulin resistance, with the most pronounced decrements observed for cognitive domains that are prefrontal- and hippocampal-dependent.

Such mitigating effects may be accounted for by attenuated central inflammation, improved insulin sensitivity, and increased expression of neurotrophic factors. Lastly, individual differences appear to play a role in this relationship, as the manipulation of physical activity characteristics, the employment of a wide array of cognitive and academic measures, the inclusion of different adiposity measures that are sensitive to neurocognitive function, and the utilization of an inter-disciplinary approach have been found to influence the relationship between physical activity and excess adiposity on brain and cognition.","Childhood obesity and its negative relation with children’s brain health has become a growing health concern.

Methods: The thigh muscles of seven subjects were imaged on an MRI scanner while performing isometric knee extensions at 40% maximal voluntary contraction. A gated velocity-encoded phase contrast MRI sequence in axial orientations yielded tissue velocity-encoded dynamic images of the four different compartments of the thigh muscles (vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), vastus intermedius (VI), and rectus femoris (RF)) at three longitudinal locations of the proximal–distal length: 17.5% (proximal), 50% (middle), and 77.5% (distal). The displacement, which is the time integration of the measured velocity, was calculated along the three orthogonal axes using a tracking algorithm. Results: The displacement of the muscle tissues was clearly nonuniform within each axial section as well as between the three axial locations. The ensemble average of the magnitude of the total displacement as a synthetic vector of the X, Y, and Z displacements was significantly larger in the VM at the middle location (p < 0.01), and in the VI at the distal location than in the other three muscles. The ensemble average of Z-axis displacement, which was almost aligned with the line of action, was significantly larger in VI than in the other three muscles in all three locations. Displacements of more than 20 mm were observed around the central aponeuroses, such as those between VI and the other surrounding muscles. Conclusions: These results imply that the quadriceps muscles act as one functional unit in normal force generation through the central aponeuroses despite complex behavior in each of the muscles, each of which possesses different physiological characteristics and architectures.","Objective: To quantify the spatial heterogeneity of displacement during voluntary isometric contraction within and between the different compartments of the quadriceps.

This study investigated how perceptual and conceptual similarities influence this generalization process. Twenty-three healthy volunteers completed a fear-generalization test as brain activity was recorded in the form of event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants were exposed to a de novo fear acquisition paradigm with four categories of conditioned stimuli (CS): two conceptual cues (animals and furniture); and two perceptual cues (blue and purple shapes). Animals (C+) and purple shapes (P+) were paired with the unconditioned stimulus (US), whereas furniture (C−) and blue shapes (P−) never were. The generalized stimuli were thus blue animals (C+P+, determined danger), blue furniture (C−P+, perceptual danger), purple animals (C+P−, conceptual danger), and purple furniture (C−P−, determined safe). We found that perceptual cues elicited larger fear responses and shorter reaction times than did conceptual cues during fear acquisition. This suggests that a perceptually related pathway might evoke greater fear than a conceptually based route. During generalization, participants were more afraid of C+ exemplars than of C− exemplars. Furthermore, C+ trials elicited greater N400 amplitudes. Thus, participants appear able to use conceptually based cues to infer the value of the current stimuli. Additionally, compared with C+ exemplars, we found an enhanced late positive potential effect in response to C− exemplars, which seems to reflect a late inhibitory process and might index safety learning. These findings may offer new insights into the pathological mechanism of anxiety disorders.","Learned fear can be generalized through both perceptual and conceptual information.

We combined electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking recordings to examine the underlying factors elicited during the serial Rapid-Automatized Naming (RAN) task that may differentiate between children with dyslexia (DYS) and chronological age controls (CAC).

Methods
Thirty children with DYS and 30 CAC (Mage = 9.79 years; age range 7.6 through 12.1 years) performed a set of serial RAN tasks. We extracted fixation-related potentials (FRPs) under phonologically similar (rime-confound) or visually similar (resembling lowercase letters) and dissimilar (non-confounding and discrete uppercase letters, respectively) control tasks.

Results
Results revealed significant differences in FRP amplitudes between DYS and CAC groups under the phonologically similar and phonologically non-confounding conditions. No differences were observed in the case of the visual conditions. Moreover, regression analysis showed that the average amplitude of the extracted components significantly predicted RAN performance.

Conclusion
FRPs capture neural components during the serial RAN task informative of differences between DYS and CAC and establish a relationship between neurocognitive processes during serial RAN and dyslexia.

Significance
We suggest our approach as a methodological model for the concurrent analysis of neurophysiological and eye-gaze data to decipher the role of RAN in reading.","Objective

Romantic rejection is an emotionally distressful experience profoundly affecting life, possibly leading to mental illness or suicide. Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide widely implicated in reducing physical pain and negative emotions; however, whether OT has an effect on reducing intense social pain (e.g., romantic rejection) remains unknown. Here, we tested the effect of OT on social pain and investigated its role in the outcome evaluation phase of social decision-making.

Methods
Electroencephalographic recordings were obtained between August 2nd and October 20th, 2020 in Shenzhen University from 61 healthy participants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a between-subject design. We defined frontal-midline theta oscillation as a neural signature of social pain and assessed self-reported pleasantness ratings for four possible romantic outcomes in an online speed-dating task.

Results
In the placebo group, greater theta power was induced by romantic rejection, being associated with rejection distress. This pattern was not observed in the OT group, where romantic rejection induced significantly decreased theta power compared to the placebo group; in the OT group, there was no association between theta power and rejection distress. Furthermore, the frontal-midline theta oscillation could be source-localized to brain areas overlapping with the physical-social pain matrix (i.e., somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, frontal pole, and supplementary motor area).

Conclusions
OT relieves social pain caused by romantic rejection, reflected in decreased frontal-midline theta oscillations and a diminished connection between theta power and rejection distress. These findings can help understand and harness OT’s pain-reducing effect on social pain.","Background

Brain Behavior and Immunity, 97, 250-259. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.06.017","BACKGROUND
Increasing evidence shows obesity and poor metabolic health are associated with cognitive deficits, but the mechanistic connections have yet to be resolved. We studied rats selectively bred for low and high intrinsic aerobic capacity in order to test the association between low physical fitness, a genetic predisposition for obesity, and brain health. We hypothesized that low-capacity runner (LCR) rats with concurrently greater levels of adiposity would have increased hippocampal inflammation and reduced plasticity compared to the more physically fit high-capacity runner (HCR) rats.

METHODS
We examined markers for inflammation and brain plasticity in the hippocampi of LCR rats and compared them to HCR rats. The effect of age was determined by studying the rats at a young age (8 weeks) and later in life (40 weeks). We used western blots and immunohistochemistry to quantify the expression of target proteins.

RESULTS
Our study showed that the number of adult-born new neurons in the hippocampus was significantly lower in LCR rats than it was in HCR rats already at a young age and that the difference became more pronounced with age. The expression of synaptic proteins was higher in young animals relative to older ones. Brain inflammation tended to be higher in LCR rats than it was in the HCR rats, and more prominent in older rats than in young ones.

CONCLUSION
Our study is the first to demonstrate that low intrinsic aerobic fitness that is associated with obesity and poor metabolic health is also linked with reduced hippocampal structural plasticity at a young age. Our results also suggest that inflammation of the brain could be one factor mediating the link between obesity and poor cognitive performance.","BACKGROUND

Traditionally, the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been made based on symptoms. Extensive studies have demonstrated that PD may lead to variation of brain activity in different frequency bands. However, frequency specific dynamic alterations of PD have not yet been explored.

New method
In order to address this gap, a novel sparse nonnegative tensor decomposition (SNTD) method was used to estimate frequency specific co-activation patterns (CAP). The difference between PD and healthy controls (HC) are investigated with the proposed framework.

Result
The difference between PD and HC mainly exists at frequency band 0.04-0.1 Hz in basal ganglia. We also found that the average intensity of PD in this frequency band is significantly correlated with the Hoehn and Yahr scale.

Comparison with existing methods
Compared with conventional CAP approach, SNTD estimates frequency specific CAPs that show alterations in PD patients.

Conclusion
SNTD provides an alternative to K-means clustering used in conventional CAP analysis. With the proposed framework, frequency specific CAPs are extracted, and alterations in PD patients are also successfully discovered.","Background

CKC has been quantified using proprioceptive stimulation (movement actuators) with fixed inter-stimulus interval (ISI). However, it is unclear how regularity of the stimulus sequence (jitter) affects CKC strength. Eighteen healthy volunteers (16 right-handed, 27.8±5.0 yrs, 7 females) participated in magnetoencephalography (MEG) session in which their right-index finger was continuously moved at ~3-Hz with constant 333 ms ISI or with 20% jitter (ISI 333±66 ms) using a pneumatic-movement actuator. Three minutes of data per condition was collected. Finger kinematics were recorded with a 3-axis accelerometer. CKC strength was defined as the peak coherence value in the Rolandic MEG gradiometer pair contralateral to the movement at 3-Hz. Both conditions resulted in significant coherence peaking in the gradiometers over the primary sensorimotor cortex. Constant stimulation yielded stronger CKC at 3 Hz (0.78±0.11 vs. 0.66±0.13, p<0.001) and its first harmonic (0.60±0.19 vs. 0.27±0.11, p<0.001) than irregular stimulation. Similarly, the respective sustained-movement evoked field was also stronger for constant stimulation. The results emphasize the importance of temporal stability of the proprioceptive stimulation sequence when quantifying CKC strength. The weaker CKC during irregular stimulation can be explained with temporal and thus spectral scattering of the paired peripheral and cortical events beyond the mean stimulation frequency. This impairs the signal-to-noise ratio of respective MEG signal and thus CKC strength. When accurately estimating and following changes in CKC strength, we suggest using precise movement actuators with constant stimulation sequence.","Proprioceptive afference can be investigated using corticokinematic coherence (CKC), which indicates coupling between limb kinematics and cortical activity.

The weaker CKC during irregular stimulation can be explained with temporal and thus spectral scattering of the paired peripheral and cortical events beyond the mean stimulation frequency. This impairs the signal-to-noise ratio of respective MEG signal and thus CKC strength. When accurately estimating and following changes in CKC strength, we suggest using precise movement actuators with constant stimulation sequence.","MEG"

The accurate and rapid detection of seizures not only reflects the efficiency of the algorithm, but also greatly reduces the burden of manual detection during long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. In this work, a stacked one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model combined with a random selection and data augmentation (RS-DA) strategy is proposed for seizure onset detection. Firstly, we segmented the long-term EEG signals using 2-sec sliding windows. Then, the 2-sec interictal and ictal segments were classified by the stacked 1D-CNN model. During model training, a RS-DA strategy was applied to solve the problem of sample imbalance, and the patient-specific model was trained with event-based K-fold (K is the number of seizures per patient) cross validation for detecting all seizures of each patient. Finally, we evaluated the performances of the proposed approach in the two levels: the segment-based level and the event-based level. The proposed method was tested on two long-term EEG datasets: the CHB-MIT sEEG dataset and the SWEC-ETHZ iEEG dataset. For the CHB-MIT sEEG dataset, we achieved 88.14 sensitivity, 99.62 specificity and 99.54 accuracy in the segment-based level. From the perspective of the event-based level, 99.31 sensitivity, 0.2/h false detection rate (FDR) and mean 8.1-sec latency were achieved. For the SWEC-ETHZ iEEG dataset, in the segment-based level, 90.09 sensitivity, 99.81 specificity and 99.73 accuracy were obtained. In the event-based level, 97.52 sensitivity, 0.07/h FDR and mean 13.2-sec latency were attained.

To disentangle those contributions, we studied the cortical tracking of various sized units of speech that are crucial for spoken language processing in children (4.7-9.3 year-olds, N=34) and adults (N=19). We measured participants’ magnetoencephalogram (MEG) responses to syllables, words and sentences, calculated the coherence between the speech signal and MEG responses at the level of words and sentences, and further examined auditory evoked responses to syllables. Age-related differences were found for coherence values at the delta and theta frequency bands.

There was no difference between hemispheres at the source level either in coherence values for word or sentence processing or in evoked response to syllables.

Results highlight the importance of the lower frequencies for speech tracking in the brain across different lexical units. Further, stimulus length affects the speech-brain associations suggesting methodological approaches should be selected carefully when studying speech envelope processing at the neural level. Speech tracking in the brain seems decoupled from more general maturation of the auditory cortex.","Speech perception is dynamic and shows changes across development.

Here, we investigated how the brain responds to unpredictable and predictable rare events. Magnetoencephalography responses were measured in adults frequently presented with somatosensory stimuli (FRE) that were occasionally replaced by two consecutively presented rare stimuli [unpredictable rare stimulus (UR) and predictable rare stimulus (PR); p = 0.1 for each]. The FRE and PR were electrical stimulations administered to either the little finger or the forefinger in a counterbalanced manner between the two conditions. The UR was a simultaneous electrical stimulation to both the forefinger and the little finger (for a smaller subgroup, the UR and FRE were counterbalanced for the stimulus properties). The grand-averaged responses were characterized by two main components: one at 30–100 ms (M55) and the other at 130–230 ms (M150) latency. Source-level analysis was conducted for the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). The M55 responses were larger for the UR and PR than for the FRE in both the SI and the SII areas and were larger for the UR than for the PR. For M150, both investigated areas showed increased activity for the UR and the PR compared to the FRE. Interestingly, although the UR was larger in stimulus energy (stimulation of two fingers at the same time) and had a larger prediction error potential than the PR, the M150 responses to these two rare stimuli did not differ in source strength in either the SI or the SII area. The results suggest that M55, but not M150, can possibly be associated with prediction error signals. These findings highlight the need for disentangling prediction error and rareness-related effects in future studies investigating prediction error signals.","Mismatch brain responses to unpredicted rare stimuli are suggested to be a neural indicator of prediction error, but this has rarely been studied in the somatosensory modality.

Magnetoencephalography responses were measured in adults frequently presented with somatosensory stimuli (FRE) that were occasionally replaced by two consecutively presented rare stimuli [unpredictable rare stimulus (UR) and predictable rare stimulus (PR); p = 0.1 for each]. The FRE and PR were electrical stimulations administered to either the little finger or the forefinger in a counterbalanced manner between the two conditions. The UR was a simultaneous electrical stimulation to both the forefinger and the little finger (for a smaller subgroup, the UR and FRE were counterbalanced for the stimulus properties). The grand-averaged responses were characterized by two main components: one at 30–100 ms (M55) and the other at 130–230 ms (M150) latency. Source-level analysis was conducted for the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). The M55 responses were larger for the UR and PR than for the FRE in both the SI and the SII areas and were larger for the UR than for the PR. For M150, both investigated areas showed increased activity for the UR and the PR compared to the FRE. Interestingly, although the UR was larger in stimulus energy (stimulation of two fingers at the same time) and had a larger prediction error potential than the PR, the M150 responses to these two rare stimuli did not differ in source strength in either the SI or the SII area. The results suggest that M55, but not M150, can possibly be associated with prediction error signals. These findings highlight the need for disentangling prediction error and rareness-related effects in future studies investigating prediction error signals.","MEG"

BMC Womens Health, 21, Article 133. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-021-01275-8","Background
Menopausal transition exposes women to an early decline in muscle force and motor function. Changes in muscle quality and function, especially in lower limbs, are crucial, as they expose individuals to increased risk of falls. To elucidate some of the related neuromuscular mechanisms, we investigated cortical inhibition and peripheral muscle twitch force potentiation in women during the early and late stages of perimenopause.
Methods
Participants were 63 women aged 48–55 years categorized as early (EP, n = 25) or late (LP, n = 38) perimenopausal according to serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and menstrual diaries. EP women had an irregular menstrual cycle and FSH < 25 IU/L, while LP women had an irregular cycle and > 25 IU/L. We examined motor evoked potential (MEP) and silent period (SP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), in the tibialis anterior muscle at 20%, 40%, and 60% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) levels, and twitch force potentiation in plantar flexors.
Results
EP group showed a longer SP duration in 40% MVC condition and larger motor evoked potential amplitude in 20% MVC condition compared to the LP group. No group difference was detected in twitch force potentiation; however, it correlated negatively with FSH levels. Other factors, such as age, height, body mass index, or physical activity did not explain group differences.
Conclusions
Our preliminary results indicate subtle modulation in both TMS-induced inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms and twitch force potentiation in women already in the late perimenopausal stage. This suggests that the reduction of estrogens may have an accelerating role in the aging process of neuromuscular control.","Background

Age-related deficient maintenance of auditory information in working memory might affect whether and how lower-level prediction errors propagate to the higher level.","EEG"

BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation, 13, Article 17. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13102-021-00242-y","Background
Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) have problems in everyday tasks such as walking and climbing stairs due to a combination of neuromuscular impairments such as spasticity, muscle weakness, reduced joint flexibility and poor coordination. Development of evidence-based interventions are in pivotal role in the development of better targeted rehabilitation of CP, and thus in maintaining their motor function and wellbeing. Our aim is to investigate the efficacy of an individually tailored, multifaceted exercise intervention (EXECP) in children and young adults with CP. EXECP is composed of strength, flexibility and gait training. Furthermore, this study aims to verify the short-term retention of the adaptations three months after the end of the EXECP intervention.

Methods
Twenty-four children and young adults with spastic CP will be recruited to participate in a 9-month research project with a 3-month training intervention, consisting of two to three 90-min sessions per week. In each session, strength training for the lower limbs and trunk muscles, flexibility training for the lower limbs and inclined treadmill gait training will be performed. We will evaluate muscle strength, joint flexibility, neuromuscular and cardiometabolic parameters. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design with two pre-tests and two post-tests all interspaced by three months is used. In addition to the CP participants, 24 typically developing age and sex-matched participants will perform the two pre-tests (i.e. no intervention) to provide normative data.

Discussion
This study has a comprehensive approach examining longitudinal effects of wide variety of variables ranging from physical activity and gross motor function to sensorimotor functions of the brain and neuromuscular and cardiometabolic parameters, providing novel information about the adaptation mechanisms in cerebral palsy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first intervention study providing supervised combined strength, flexibility and gait training for young individuals with CP.","Background

Adolescents have experienced decreased aerobic fitness levels and insufficient physical activity levels over the past decades. While both physical activity and aerobic fitness are related to physical and mental health, little is known concerning how they manifest in the brain during this stage of development, characterized by significant physical and psychosocial changes. The aim of the study is to examine the associations between both physical activity and aerobic fitness with brains’ functional connectivity.

Methods
Here, we examined how physical activity and aerobic fitness are associated with local and interhemispheric functional connectivity of the adolescent brain (n = 59), as measured with resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Physical activity was measured by hip‐worn accelerometers, and aerobic fitness by a maximal 20‐m shuttle run test.

Results
We found that higher levels of moderate‐to‐vigorous intensity physical activity, but not aerobic fitness, were linked to increased local functional connectivity as measured by regional homogeneity in 13–16‐year‐old participants. However, we did not find evidence for significant associations between adolescents’ physical activity or aerobic fitness and interhemispheric connectivity, as indicated by homotopic connectivity.

Conclusions
These results suggest that physical activity, but not aerobic fitness, is related to local functional connectivity in adolescents. Moreover, physical activity shows an association with a specific brain area involved in motor functions but did not display any widespread associations with other brain regions. These results can advance our understanding of the behavior–brain associations in adolescents.","Introduction

We confirmed that cortical gating to proprioceptive stimuli is comparable to other somatosensory and auditory domains, and between children and adults. Gating occurred broadly beyond SI cortex. Spatial ICA revealed several consistent response patterns in various cortical regions which would have been challenging to detect with more commonly applied equivalent current dipole or distributed source estimates.","MEG"

Method: The model adopts a linear function to address different numbers of inputs, thereby extending model applications.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides a direct, non-invasive measure of cortical processing with high spatiotemporal accuracy, and is thus well suited for assessment of functional brain damage in patients with language difficulties. This MEG study aimed to identify, in a delayed picture naming paradigm, source-localized evoked activity and modulations of cortical oscillations that show high test–retest reliability across measurement days in healthy individuals, demonstrating their applicability in clinical settings. For patients with a language disorder picture naming can be a challenging task. Therefore, we also determined whether a semantic judgment task (‘Is this item living?’) with a spoken response (“yes”/“no”) would suffice to induce comparably consistent activity within brain regions related to language production. The MEG data was collected from 19 healthy participants on two separate days. In picture naming, evoked activity was consistent across measurement days (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)>0.4) in the left frontal (400–800 ms after image onset), sensorimotor (200–800 ms), parietal (200–600 ms), temporal (200–800 ms), occipital (400–800 ms) and cingulate (600–800 ms) regions, as well as the right temporal (600–800 ms) region.

The delayed naming task showed typical beta oscillatory suppression in premotor and sensorimotor regions (800–1200 ms) but other consistent modulations of oscillatory activity were mostly observed in posterior cortical regions that have not typically been associated with language processing.

Independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely used for blind source separation in the field of medical imaging. However, despite of previous substantial efforts, the stability of ICA components remains a critical issue which has not been adequately addressed, despite numerous previous efforts. Most critical is the inconsistency of some of the extracted components when ICA is run with different model orders (MOs).
New Method
In this study, a novel method of determining the consistency of component analysis (CoCA) is proposed to evaluate the consistency of extracted components with different model orders. In the method, “consistent components” (CCs) are defined as those which can be extracted repeatably over a range of model orders.
Result
The efficacy of the method was evaluated with simulation data and fMRI datasets. With our method, the simulation result showed a clear difference of consistency between ground truths and noise.
Comparison with existing methods
The information criteria were implemented to provide suggestions for the optimal model order, where some of the ICs were revealed inconsistent in our proposed method.
Conclusions
This method provided an objective protocol for choosing CCs of an ICA decomposition of a data matrix, independent of model order. This is especially useful with high model orders, where noise or other disturbances could possibly lead to an instability of the components.","Background

Manual sleep staging on overnight polysomnography (PSG) is time-consuming and laborious. This study aims to develop an end-to-end automatic sleep staging method in single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from PSG recordings.

Methods
A convolutional neural network called CCN-SE is proposed to address sleep staging tasks. The proposed method was efficiently constructed by stacking a collection of consecutive convolutional micro-networks (CCNs) and squeeze-excitation (SE) block. The designed model took multi-epoch (3 epochs) raw EEG signals as its input and relabeled the input. We trained and tested this model on different single-channel EEG (C4-A1 and Fpz-Cz) signals from two open datasets and then explored the model’s generalization ability and the channel mismatch problem using clinical PSG files.

Results
Results of the five-fold cross-validation show that our model achieved the good overall accuracies in SHHS1 (88.1%) and Sleep-EDFx (85.3%) datasets. Furthermore, the observed scores on 10 healthy clinical sleep recordings using the single EEG channel (C4-M1) based on two trained weights were 72.3% and 81.9%.

Conclusion
The obtained performance on two sleep datasets reveals the efficiency and generalization capability of the proposed method in sleep staging in EEG. Furthermore, the results on the clinical PSG recordings suggest that the proposed model can alleviate the problem of channel mismatch to some extent.

Significance
This study proposes a novel method for automatic sleep staging that can be easily utilized in portable sleep monitoring devices and draws attention to the channel mismatch in sleep staging.","Objective

Thirteen healthy right-handed volunteers (7 females, 21.7 ± 4.3 years) participated two separate EEG sessions 12.6±1.3 months apart.

Additionally, evoked EROs sometimes cannot be fully extracted using the conventional time-frequency analysis (TFA) because they may be overlapped with each other or with artifacts in time, frequency, and space domains. To further investigate the related neuronal processes, a novel approach was proposed including three steps: (1) extract the temporal and spatial components of interest simultaneously by temporal principal component analysis (PCA) and Promax rotation and project them to the electrode fields for correcting their variance and polarity indeterminacies, (2) calculate the time-frequency representations (TFRs) of the back-projected components, and (3) compute the regions of evoked EROs of interest on TFRs objectively using the edge detection algorithm.

The human ability to implement a sustained attention task is supported by brain networks that dynamically formed and dissolved through oscillatory synchronization. The decrement of vigilance induced by prolonged task engagement affects sustained attention. However, little is known about which stage or combinations are affected by vigilance decrement. Here, we applied an analysis framework composed of weighted phase lag index (wPLI) and tensor component analysis (TCA) to an EEG dataset collected during 80 min sustained attention task to examine the electrophysiological basis of such effect. We aimed to characterize the phase-coupling networks to untangle different phases involved in sustained attention and study how they are modulated by vigilance decrement. We computed the time–frequency domain wPLI from each block and subject and constructed a fourth-order tensor, containing the time, frequency, functional connectivity (FC), and blocks × subjects. This tensor was subjected to the TCA to identify the interacted and low-dimensional components representing the frequency-specific dynamic FC (fdFC). We extracted four types of neuromakers during a sustained attention task, namely the pre-stimulus alpha right-lateralized parieto-occipital FC, the post-stimulus theta fronto-parieto-occipital FC, delta fronto-parieto-occipital FC, and beta right/left sensorimotor FCs. All these fdFCs were impaired by vigilance decrement. These fdFCs, except for the beta left sensorimotor network, were restored by rewards, although the restoration by reward in the beta right sensorimotor network was transient. These findings provide implications for dissociable effects of vigilance decrement on sustained attention by utilizing the tensor-based framework.","Sustained attention encompasses a cascade of fundamental functions.

Music therapy improves neuronal activity and connectivity of healthy persons and patients with clinical symptoms of neurological diseases like Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and major depression. Despite the plethora of publications that have reported the positive effects of music interventions, little is known about how music improves neuronal activity and connectivity in afflicted patients.

Methods
For patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease (PD), we propose a daily 25-min music-based synchronous finger tapping (SFT) intervention for 8 weeks. Eligible participants with PD are split into two groups: an intervention group and a control arm. In addition, a third cohort of healthy controls will be recruited. Assessment of finger tapping performances, the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), an n-back test, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), as well as oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR), and total hemoglobin activation collected by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are measured at baseline, week 4 (during), week 8 (post), and week 12 (retention) of the study. Data collected from the two PD groups are compared to baseline performances from healthy controls.

Discussion
This exploratory prospective trial study investigates the cortical neuronal activity and therapeutic effects associated with an auditory external cue used to induce automatic and implicit synchronous finger tapping in patients diagnosed with PD. The extent to which the intervention is effective may be dependent on the severity of the disease.

However, much less is known about the underlying effect of amyloid pathology on single cell activity. Here, we used high density silicon probe recordings from frontal cortex area of 9 months old APP/PS1 mice to show that Local Field Potential (LFP) power in the theta and beta band is increased in transgenic animals, while single cell firing rates, specifically of putative pyramidal cells, are significantly reduced. At the same time, these sparsely firing pyramidal cells phase-lock their spiking activity more strongly to the ongoing theta and beta rhythms. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anti-epileptic drug, levetiracetam, counteracts these effects by increasing pyramidal cell firing rates in APP/PS1 mice and uncoupling pyramidal cells and interneurons. Overall, our results highlight reduced firing rates of cortical pyramidal cells as a pathophysiological phenotype in APP/PS1 mice and indicate a potentially beneficial effect of acute levetiracetam treatment.","In recent years aberrant neural oscillations in various cortical areas have emerged as a common physiological hallmark across mouse models of amyloid pathology and patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Here, we used high density silicon probe recordings from frontal cortex area of 9 months old APP/PS1 mice to show that Local Field Potential (LFP) power in the theta and beta band is increased in transgenic animals, while single cell firing rates, specifically of putative pyramidal cells, are significantly reduced. At the same time, these sparsely firing pyramidal cells phase-lock their spiking activity more strongly to the ongoing theta and beta rhythms. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anti-epileptic drug, levetiracetam, counteracts these effects by increasing pyramidal cell firing rates in APP/PS1 mice and uncoupling pyramidal cells and interneurons. Overall, our results highlight reduced firing rates of cortical pyramidal cells as a pathophysiological phenotype in APP/PS1 mice and indicate a potentially beneficial effect of acute levetiracetam treatment.","Muu neurotiede"

The functional connectivity (FC) of major depression disorder (MDD) has not been well studied under naturalistic and continuous stimuli conditions. In this study, we investigated the frequency-specific FC of MDD patients exposed to conditions of music perception using ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG).
Methods
First, we applied phase lag index (PLI) method to calculate the connectivity matrices and graph theory-based methods to measure the topology of brain networks across different frequency bands. Then, classification methods were adopted to identify the most discriminate frequency band for the diagnosis of MDD.
Results
During music perception, MDD patients exhibited a decreased connectivity pattern in the delta band but an increased connectivity pattern in the beta band. Healthy people showed a left hemisphere-dominant phenomenon, but MDD patients did not show such a lateralized effect. Support vector machine (SVM) achieved the best classification performance in the beta frequency band with an accuracy of 89.7%, sensitivity of 89.4% and specificity of 89.9%.
Conclusions
MDD patients exhibited an altered FC in delta and beta bands, and the beta band showed a superiority in the diagnosis of MDD.

We collected data in aviation simulations and forestry simulations, to show both similarities and differences between different learning situations. Both settings utilize high quality virtual simulations allowing learning to occur in near authentic situations.

The learning situations were structured pedagogically in a similar way.

The instructor guides the learner through progressively more difficult simulation exercises, allowing to extract experiential, physiological and neurophysiological correlates that reliably associate with the demands of the learning in a naturalistic situation. 12 students and 4 teachers took part in the study. One student and one teacher were measured simultaneously during the learning situation. The data collection methods included both quantitative measures (synchronized heart rate variability, HRV, and electroencephalography, EEG, as well as structured questionnaires) and qualitative measures (individual interviews and video recordings). In addition to data collection during and immediately after the learning situations (1-2 hours measurements), HRV measures with an electronic diary were collected during a baseline period of 4 days. All learning situations were video recorded, and the recorded simulation exercises were annotated by the students during the interviews with a special emphasis on pointing out the episodes which were memorable and had particular meaning for learning.

The qualitative and quantitative data are first analysed independently. For the quantitative data, the focus is on extracting reliable artefact-free signatures that reflect the state and reactivity of autonomic and central nervous system along different learning situations and task demands. The analysis of qualitative data emphasises understanding the episodes that participants considered meaningful during learning. In the next stage, qualitative and quantitative data is interpreted together to identify the reproducible elements in physiology that reflect emotionally and learning-wise meaningful episodes, in the learner and instructor separately, and in the interaction (synchrony measures) between learner and instructor.

First priority is to establish understanding of the feasibility of achieving reliable physiological and neurophysiological correlates of learning experience during naturalistic learning situations. Second, if feasible, this type of design enables us to more comprehensively understand the factors that influence the individual experiences and success of learning interaction. Current theories concerning adult learning mainly approach learning at experiential (and psychological) level, and there is a lack of proper framework for integrating physiological measures in the same theory.

Muscle, bone and tendon respond anabolically to mechanical forces. Whether the intervertebral disc (IVD) can benefit from exercise is unclear.
Purpose
To examine whether exercise can beneficially affect IVD characteristics.
Study design/setting
This is a single-blinded 6-month randomised controlled trial (ACTRN12615001270505) in an exercise and physiotherapy clinic.
Patient sample
Forty patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (NSCLBP) are included in this study.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome was lumbar IVD T2 time (MRI). Secondary outcomes included IVD diffusion coefficient and IVD expansion with short-duration lying.
Methods
Twenty patients progressively loaded their lumbar IVDs (exercise) via an exercise programme involving progressive upright aerobic and resistance exercises targeting the trunk and major muscle groups and were compared to twenty patients who performed motor control training and manual therapy (control). Testing occurred at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.
Results
Seventeen exercise and fifteen control patients completed the interventions. There were no group-by-time differences in T2 time of the entire IVD (exercise 94.1 ± 10.0 ms vs. control 96.5 ± 9.3 ms, p = 0.549). Exercise patients had shorter T2 time in the posterior annulus at 6 months (82.7 ± 6.8 ms vs. 85.1 ± 8.0 ms, p = 0.028). Exercise patients showed higher L5/S1 apparent diffusion coefficients and decreased IVD height at 3 months (both p ≤ 0.050). After adjustments for multiple comparisons, differences lost statistical significance. Per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses yielded similar findings.
Conclusions
This trial found that 6 months of exercise did not benefit the IVD of people with NSCLBP. Based on this index study, future studies could investigate the effect of exercise on IVD in different populations, with different types, durations and/or intensities of exercise, and using different IVD markers.","Background context

Exercise patients had shorter T2 time in the posterior annulus at 6 months (82.7 ± 6.8 ms vs. 85.1 ± 8.0 ms, p = 0.028). Exercise patients showed higher L5/S1 apparent diffusion coefficients and decreased IVD height at 3 months (both p ≤ 0.050). After adjustments for multiple comparisons, differences lost statistical significance. Per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses yielded similar findings.
Conclusions
This trial found that 6 months of exercise did not benefit the IVD of people with NSCLBP. Based on this index study, future studies could investigate the effect of exercise on IVD in different populations, with different types, durations and/or intensities of exercise, and using different IVD markers.","Magneettikuvaus"

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been successfully used for electroencephalography (EEG) spectral analysis. Since NMF was proposed in the 1990s, many adaptive algorithms have been developed. However, the performance of their use in EEG data analysis has not been fully compared. Here, we provide a comparison of four NMF algorithms in terms of accuracy of estimation, stability (repeatability of the results) and time complexity of algorithms with simulated data. In the practical application of NMF algorithms, stability plays an important role, which was an emphasis in the comparison. A Hierarchical clustering algorithm was implemented to evaluate the stability of NMF algorithms.

Results
In simulation-based comprehensive analysis of fit, stability, accuracy of estimation and time complexity, hierarchical alternating least squares (HALS) low-rank NMF algorithm (lraNMF_HALS) outperformed the other three NMF algorithms. In the application of lraNMF_HALS for real resting-state EEG data analysis, stable and interpretable features were extracted.

Conclusion
Based on the results of assessment, our recommendation is to use lraNMF_HALS, providing the most accurate and robust estimation.","Background

Thirty (18 males and 12 females) endurance-trained runners without a history of spinal pain aged 33–55 years were recruited. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed under one rest and five exercise conditions, which involved variations in axial loading and postural cues.

Transversus abdominis contraction was greatest in the ‘stretch tall plus arm extension’ (length, − 15%, P < 0.001; thickness, + 19%, P < 0.001) and ‘stretch tall plus arm extension and thoracic cue’ (length, − 16%, P < 0.001; thickness, + 18%, P < 0.001) conditions.

However, little is known about the cortical reorganization for supporting letter-speech sound learning, particularly the brain dynamics during the learning of grapheme-phoneme associations. In the present study, we trained 30 Finnish participants (mean age: 24.33 years, SD: 3.50 years) to associate novel foreign letters with familiar Finnish speech sounds on two consecutive days (first day ∼ 50 minutes; second day ∼ 25 minutes), while neural activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Two sets of audiovisual stimuli were used for the training in which the grapheme-phoneme association in one set (Learnable) could be learned based on the different learning cues provided, but not in the other set (Control). The learning progress was tracked at a trial-by-trial basis and used to segment different learning stages for the MEG source analysis. The learning-related changes were examined by comparing the brain responses to Learnable and Control uni/multi-sensory stimuli, as well as the brain responses to learning cues at different learning stages over the two days. We found dynamic changes in brain responses related to multi-sensory processing when grapheme-phoneme associations were learned. Further, changes were observed in the brain responses to the novel letters during the learning process. We also found that some of these learning effects were observed only after memory consolidation the following day. Overall, the learning process modulated the activity in a large network of brain regions, including the superior temporal cortex and the dorsal (parietal) pathway. Most interestingly, middle- and inferior- temporal regions were engaged during multi-sensory memory encoding after the cross-modal relationship was extracted from the learning cues. Our findings highlight the brain dynamics and plasticity related to the learning of letter-speech sound associations and provide a more refined model of grapheme-phoneme learning in reading acquisition.","Learning to associate written letters with speech sounds is crucial for the initial phase of acquiring reading skills.

In the present study, we trained 30 Finnish participants (mean age: 24.33 years, SD: 3.50 years) to associate novel foreign letters with familiar Finnish speech sounds on two consecutive days (first day ∼ 50 minutes; second day ∼ 25 minutes), while neural activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Two sets of audiovisual stimuli were used for the training in which the grapheme-phoneme association in one set (Learnable) could be learned based on the different learning cues provided, but not in the other set (Control). The learning progress was tracked at a trial-by-trial basis and used to segment different learning stages for the MEG source analysis. The learning-related changes were examined by comparing the brain responses to Learnable and Control uni/multi-sensory stimuli, as well as the brain responses to learning cues at different learning stages over the two days. We found dynamic changes in brain responses related to multi-sensory processing when grapheme-phoneme associations were learned. Further, changes were observed in the brain responses to the novel letters during the learning process. We also found that some of these learning effects were observed only after memory consolidation the following day. Overall, the learning process modulated the activity in a large network of brain regions, including the superior temporal cortex and the dorsal (parietal) pathway. Most interestingly, middle- and inferior- temporal regions were engaged during multi-sensory memory encoding after the cross-modal relationship was extracted from the learning cues. Our findings highlight the brain dynamics and plasticity related to the learning of letter-speech sound associations and provide a more refined model of grapheme-phoneme learning in reading acquisition.","MEG"

The motor cortex (M1) appears to be a primary site of adaptation following both a single session, and repeated strength-training sessions across multiple weeks. Given that a single session of strength-training is sufficient to induce modification at the level of the M1 and corticospinal tract, this study sought to determine how these acute changes in M1 and corticospinal tract might accumulate across the course of a 2-week heavy-load strength-training program.

Methods
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to infer corticospinal excitability (CSE), intracortical facilitation (ICF), short and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) and silent period duration prior to and following each training session during a 2-week heavy-load strength-training period.

Following 2-weeks of strength-training, increases in strength (15.5%, P = 0.01) were accompanied by an increase in CSE (44%, P = 0.006) and reductions in both silent period duration (14%, P < 0.0001) and SICI (35%, P = 0.0004). Early training sessions acutely increased CSE and ICF, and acutely reduced silent period duration and SICI. However, later training sessions failed to modulate SICI and ICF, with substantial adaptations occurring offline between training sessions. No acute or retained changes in LICI were observed. Co-contraction of antagonists reduced by 36% following 2-weeks of strength-training.

Conclusions
Collectively, these results indicate that corticospinal plasticity occurs within and between training sessions throughout a training period in distinct early and later stages that are modulated by separate mechanisms of plasticity. The development of strength is akin to the previously reported changes that occur following motor skill training.","Purpose
The motor cortex (M1) appears to be a primary site of adaptation following both a single session, and repeated strength-training sessions across multiple weeks. Given that a single session of strength-training is sufficient to induce modification at the level of the M1 and corticospinal tract, this study sought to determine how these acute changes in M1 and corticospinal tract might accumulate across the course of a 2-week heavy-load strength-training program.

Methods: We employed a with-in group repeated measures design with an anode HD-tDCS protocol (2 mA, 20 min, the precuneus) on 11 (2 vegetative state and nine minimally conscious state) patients with DOCs. MMN and Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scores were measured at four time points: before the treatment of HD-tDCS (T0), after a single session of HD-tDCS (T1), after the treatment of 7 days (T2) and 14 days (T3). A frequency-deviant oddball paradigm with two deviation magnitudes (standard stimulus: 1000 Hz, small deviant stimuli: 1050 Hz, large deviant stimuli: 1200 Hz) was adopted to elicit MMN.

Results: Significant improvements of CRS-R score were found after 7-day (T2) and 14-day (T3) treatment compared with baseline (T0). Regarding the MMN, significant improvements of MMN amplitudes were observed after a single session of stimulation (T1), 7-day (T2) and 14-day treatment (T3) compared with baseline (T0). Additionally, there were significant negative correlations between CRS-R scores and MMN amplitudes elicited by both large and small deviant stimuli.

Conclusion: Long-term HD-tDCS over precuneus might improve signs of consciousness in patients with DOCs as measured by CRS-R total scores, and MMN could be an assistant assessment in the course of tDCS treatment.","Objective: To evaluate the effects of long-term High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over precuneus on the level of consciousness (LOC) and the relationship between Mismatch negativity (MMN) and the LOC over the therapy period in patients with Disorders of consciousness (DOCs).

Objective: To determine if 5 daily sessions of tDCS modulate peripheral metabolites in healthy adult men.
Methods: This double-blind, randomized controlled trial involved 79 healthy males (aged 20–40 years) divided into two groups, one receiving tDCS (2 mA), the other being sham stimulated. The anode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the cathode over the corresponding contralateral area.

The ~20-Hz brain rhythm can be detected by both magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), but the comparability of these methods has not been evaluated. Here, we compare these two methods in the evaluating of ~20-Hz activity modulation to somatosensory stimuli.
Rhythmic ~20-Hz activity during separate tactile and proprioceptive stimulation of the right and left index finger was recorded simultaneously with MEG and EEG in twenty-four healthy participants.
Both tactile and proprioceptive stimulus produced a clear suppression at 300–350 ​ms followed by a subsequent rebound at 700–900 ​ms after stimulus onset, detected at similar latencies both with MEG and EEG. The relative amplitudes of suppression and rebound correlated strongly between MEG and EEG recordings. However, the relative strength of suppression and rebound in the contralateral hemisphere (with respect to the stimulated hand) was significantly stronger in MEG than in EEG recordings.
Our results indicate that MEG recordings produced signals with higher signal-to-noise ratio than EEG, favoring MEG as an optimal tool for studies evaluating sensorimotor cortical functions. However, the strong correlation between MEG and EEG results encourages the use of EEG when translating studies to clinical practice. The clear advantage of EEG is the availability of the method in hospitals and bed-side measurements at the acute phase.","Modulation of the ~20-Hz brain rhythm has been used to evaluate the functional state of the sensorimotor cortex both in healthy subjects and patients, such as stroke patients.

Both tactile and proprioceptive stimulus produced a clear suppression at 300–350 ​ms followed by a subsequent rebound at 700–900 ​ms after stimulus onset, detected at similar latencies both with MEG and EEG. The relative amplitudes of suppression and rebound correlated strongly between MEG and EEG recordings. However, the relative strength of suppression and rebound in the contralateral hemisphere (with respect to the stimulated hand) was significantly stronger in MEG than in EEG recordings.
Our results indicate that MEG recordings produced signals with higher signal-to-noise ratio than EEG, favoring MEG as an optimal tool for studies evaluating sensorimotor cortical functions. However, the strong correlation between MEG and EEG results encourages the use of EEG when translating studies to clinical practice. The clear advantage of EEG is the availability of the method in hospitals and bed-side measurements at the acute phase.","EEG;MEG"

Caffeine enhances exercise performance but its mechanisms of action remain unclear. This study investigated its effects on neuromuscular function in a non‐fatigued state and during fatiguing exercise.

Methods
Eighteen males participated in this randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover trial. Baseline measures included plantarflexion force, drop jump, squat jump, voluntary activation of triceps surae muscle, soleus muscle contractile properties, M‐wave, alpha‐motoneuron excitability (H‐reflex), corticospinal excitability, short‐interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), silent period evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (SP) and plasma potassium and caffeine concentration. Immediately after baseline testing, participants ingested caffeine (6 mg kg−1) or placebo. After a 1‐h rest, baseline measures were repeated, followed by a fatiguing stretch‐shortening cycle exercise (sets of 40 bilateral rebound jumps on a sledge apparatus) until task failure. Neuromuscular testing was carried out throughout and after the fatigue protocol.

Results
Caffeine enhanced drop jump height (4.2%) and decreased SP (12.6%) in a non‐fatigued state. A caffeine‐related decrease in SP and SICI prior to the fatiguing activity was associated with an increased time to task failure. The participants who benefited from an improved performance on the caffeine day, reported a significantly lower sense of effort during exercise and had an accelerated post‐exercise recovery of M‐wave amplitude.

Conclusion
Caffeine modulates inhibitory mechanisms of the central nervous system, recovery of M‐wave amplitude and perception of effort. This study lays the groundwork for future examinations of differences of caffeine‐induced neuromuscular changes between those who are deemed to benefit from caffeine ingestion and those who are not.","Purpose

Taijin-kyofusho (TKS), a subtype common in East Asia, additionally includes a fear of embarrassing others. TKS individuals are hypersensitive to others' feelings and worry that their physical or behavioral defects humiliate others. To explore the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms, we compared TKS ratings with questionnaire-based empathic disposition, cognitive flexibility (set-shifting), and empathy-associated brain activity in 23 Japanese adults. During 3-tesla functional MRI, subjects watched video clips of badly singing people who expressed either authentic embarrassment (EMBAR) or hubristic pride (PRIDE). We expected the EMBAR singers to embarrass the viewers via emotion-sharing involving affective empathy (affEMP), and the PRIDE singers to embarrass via perspective-taking involving cognitive empathy (cogEMP). During affEMP (EMBAR > PRIDE), TKS scores correlated positively with dispositional affEMP (personal-distress dimension) and with amygdala activity. During cogEMP (EMBAR < PRIDE), TKS scores correlated negatively with cognitive flexibility and with activity of the posterior superior temporal sulcus/temporoparietal junction (pSTS/TPJ). Intersubject correlation analysis implied stronger involvement of the anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and premotor cortex during affEMP than cogEMP and stronger involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and pSTS/TPJ during cogEMP than affEMP. During cogEMP, the whole-brain functional connectivity was weaker the higher the TKS scores. The observed imbalance between affEMP and cogEMP, and the disruption of functional brain connectivity, likely deteriorate cognitive processing during embarrassing situations in persons who suffer from other-oriented social anxiety dominated by empathic embarrassment.","Social-anxiety disorder involves a fear of embarrassing oneself in the presence of others. Taijin-kyofusho (TKS), a subtype common in East Asia, additionally includes a fear of embarrassing others. TKS individuals are hypersensitive to others' feelings and worry that their physical or behavioral defects humiliate others. To explore the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms, we compared TKS ratings with questionnaire-based empathic disposition, cognitive flexibility (set-shifting), and empathy-associated brain activity in 23 Japanese adults. During 3-tesla functional MRI, subjects watched video clips of badly singing people who expressed either authentic embarrassment (EMBAR) or hubristic pride (PRIDE). We expected the EMBAR singers to embarrass the viewers via emotion-sharing involving affective empathy (affEMP), and the PRIDE singers to embarrass via perspective-taking involving cognitive empathy (cogEMP). During affEMP (EMBAR > PRIDE), TKS scores correlated positively with dispositional affEMP (personal-distress dimension) and with amygdala activity.

Ongoing EEG data are recorded as mixtures of stimulus-elicited EEG, spontaneous EEG and noises, which require advanced signal processing techniques for separation and analysis. Existing methods cannot simultaneously consider common and individual characteristics among/within subjects when extracting stimulus-elicited brain activities from ongoing EEG elicited by 512-s long modern tango music.

New method
Aiming to discover the commonly music-elicited brain activities among subjects, we provide a comprehensive framework based on fast double-coupled nonnegative tensor decomposition (FDC-NTD) algorithm. The proposed algorithm with a generalized model is capable of simultaneously decomposing EEG tensors into common and individual components.

Results
With the proposed framework, the brain activities can be effectively extracted and sorted into the clusters of interest. The proposed algorithm based on the generalized model achieved higher fittings and stronger robustness. In addition to the distribution of centro-parietal and occipito-parietal regions with theta and alpha oscillations, the music-elicited brain activities were also located in the frontal region and distributed in the 4–11 Hz band.

Comparison with existing method(s)
The present study, by providing a solution of how to separate common stimulus-elicited brain activities using coupled tensor decomposition, has shed new light on the processing and analysis of ongoing EEG data in multi-subject level. It can also reveal more links between brain responses and the continuous musical stimulus.

Conclusions
The proposed framework based on coupled tensor decomposition can be successfully applied to group analysis of ongoing EEG data, as it can be reliably inferred that those brain activities we obtained are associated with musical stimulus.","Background

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to determine whether a single session of heavy-load strength training, light-load strength training or skill training differentially modulates the corticospinal pathway. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the excitatory and inhibitory circuitry of the motor cortex following a single session of skill training, and following a single session of light-load and heavy-load strength training. Following a single session of training, participants in all groups experienced comparable increases in corticospinal excitability (ranging from 38 to 46%, all p < 0.05); however, disparity was observed in the inhibitory responses.

Frontiers in Physiology, 10, Article 824. https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00824","Introduction: The majority of young women use oral contraceptives (OCs). Use of OCs has been associated with lower myofibrillar protein and tendon collagen synthesis rates, but it is unknown whether OCs will limit the adaptive response of myotendinous tissue to resistance training. 

Design and Methods: Fourteen healthy untrained young regular OC users (24 +/- 1 years, fat% 32 +/- 1, 35 +/- 2 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)) and 14 NOC users (non-OC, controls) (24 +/- 1 years, fat% 32 +/- 2, 34 +/- 2 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)) performed a 10-week supervised lower extremity progressive resistance training program. Before and after the intervention biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle and the patellar tendon were obtained. Muscle (quadriceps) and tendon cross-sectional area (CSA) was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and muscle fiber CSA was determined by histochemistry. Maximal isometric knee extension strength was assessed by dynamometry while 1 repetition maximum (RM) was determined during knee extension. 

Results: Training enhanced CSA in both muscle (p < 0.001) and tendon (p < 0.01). A trend toward a greater increase in muscle CSA was observed for OC (11%) compared to NOC (8%) (interaction p = 0.06). Analysis of mean muscle fiber type CSA showed a trend toward an increase in type II muscle fiber area in both groups (p = 0.11, interaction p = 0.98), whereas type I muscle fiber CSA increased in the OC group (n = 9, 3821 +/- 197 to 4490 +/- 313 mm(2), p < 0.05), but not in NOC (n = 7, 4020 +/- 348 to 3777 +/- 354 mm(2), p = 0.40) (interaction p < 0.05). Post hoc analyses indicated that the effect of OCs on muscle mass increase was induced by the OC-users (n = 7), who used OCs containing 30 mu g ethinyl estradiol (EE), whereas the response in users taking OCs with 20 mu g EE (n = 7) did not differ from NOC. Both the OC and NOC group experienced an increase in maximal knee strength (p < 0.001) and 1RM leg extension (p < 0.001) after the training period with no difference between groups. 

Conclusion: Use of OCs during a 10-week supervised progressive resistance training program was associated with a trend toward a greater increase in muscle mass and a significantly greater increase in type I muscle fiber area compared to controls. Yet, use of OCs did not influence the overall increase in muscle strength related to training.","Introduction: The majority of young women use oral contraceptives (OCs).

Transgenic mice with amyloid plaque pathology also display epileptic seizures, but those are too infrequent to assess the effect of anti-epileptic treatments. Besides spontaneous seizures, these mice also display frequent epileptic spiking in epidural EEG recordings, and these have provided a means to test potential drug treatment to AD-related epilepsy. However, the origin of EEG spikes in transgenic AD model mice has remained elusive, which makes it difficult to relate electrophysiology with underlying pathology at the cellular and molecular level. Using multiple cortical and subcortical electrodes in freely moving APP/PS1 transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates, we identified several types of epileptic spikes among over 15 800 spikes visible with cortical screw electrodes based on their source localization. Cortical spikes associated with muscle twitches, cortico-hippocampal spikes, and spindle and fast-spindle associated spikes were present equally often in both APP/PS1 and wild-type mice, whereas pure cortical spikes were slightly more common in APP/PS1 mice. In contrast, spike-wave discharges, cortico-hippocampal spikes with afterhyperpolarization and giant spikes were seen almost exclusively in APP/PS1 mice but only in a subset of them. Interestingly, different subtypes of spikes responded differently to anti-epileptic drugs ethosuximide and levetiracetam. From the translational point most relevant may be the giant spikes generated in the hippocampus that reached an amplitude up to +/- 5 mV in the hippocampal channel. As in AD patients, they occurred exclusively during sleep. Further, we could demonstrate that a high number of giant spikes in APP/PS1 mice predicts seizures. These data show that by only adding a pair of hippocampal deep electrodes and EMG to routine cortical epidural screw electrodes and by taking into account underlying cortical oscillations, one can drastically refine the analysis of cortical spike data. This new approach provides a powerful tool to preclinical testing of potential new treatment options for AD related epilepsy.","Epileptic activity without visible convulsions is common in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and may contribute adversely to the disease progress and symptoms.

As in AD patients, they occurred exclusively during sleep. Further, we could demonstrate that a high number of giant spikes in APP/PS1 mice predicts seizures. These data show that by only adding a pair of hippocampal deep electrodes and EMG to routine cortical epidural screw electrodes and by taking into account underlying cortical oscillations, one can drastically refine the analysis of cortical spike data. This new approach provides a powerful tool to preclinical testing of potential new treatment options for AD related epilepsy.","EEG"

(2019). Negative emotional state slows down movement speed : behavioral and neural evidence. PeerJ, 7, Article e7591. https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7591","Background. Athletic performance is affected by emotional state. Athletes may underperform in competition due to poor emotion regulation. Movement speed plays an important role in many competition events. Flexible control of movement speed is critical for effective athletic performance. Although behavioral evidence showed that negative emotion can influence movement speed, the nature of the relationship remains controversial. Thus, the present study investigated how negative emotion affects movement speed and the neural mechanism underlying the interaction between emotion processing and movement control.
Methods. The present study combined electroencephalography (EEG) technology with a cued-action task to investigate the effect of negative emotion on movement speed. In total, 21 undergraduate students were recruited for this study. Participants were asked to perform six consecutive action tasks after viewing an emotional picture. Pictures
were presented in two blocks (one negative and one neutral). After the participants completed a set of tasks (neutral of negative), they were subjected to complete a 9-point self-assessment manikin scale. Participants underwent EEG while performing the tasks.
Results. At the behavior level, there was a significant main effect of emotional valence on movement speed, with participants exhibiting significantly slower movements in the negative emotional condition than in the neutral condition. EEG data showed increased theta oscillation and larger P1 amplitude in response to negative than to neural images suggesting that more cognitive resources were required to process negative than neutral images. EEG data also showed a larger late CNV area in the neutral condition than in the negative condition, which suggested that there was a significant decrease in brain activation during action tasks in negative emotional condition than in the neural. While the early CNV did not reveal a significant main effect of emotional valence.
Conclusion. The present results indicate that a negative emotion can slow movement, which is largely due to negative emotional processing consuming more resources than non-emotional processing and this interference effect mainly occurred in the late movement preparation phase.","Background.

The purpose of this study was to determine size and symmetry of TrA and multifidus muscles at rest and with contraction in endurance runners without low back pain.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Setting: A medical imaging centre in Melbourne, Australia.
Participants: Thirty middle-aged (43years±7) endurance-trained male (n=18) and female (n=12) runners without current or history of low back pain.
Outcome measures: MRI at rest and with the core engaged. The TrA and multifidus muscles were measured for thickness and length (TrA) and anteroposterior and mediolateral thickness (multifidus). Muscle activation was extrapolated from rest to contraction and compared with the same and contralateral side. Paired t-tests were performed to compare sides and contraction status.
Results: Left and right TrA and multifidus demonstrated similar parameters at rest (p>0.05). However, with contraction, the right TrA and multifidus (in mediolateral direction) were 9.2% (p=0.038) and 42% (p<0.001) thicker, respectively, than their counterparts on the left. There was no TrA thickness side difference with contraction in left-handed participants (p=0.985). When stratified by sex, the contracted TrA on the right side remained 8.4% thicker, but it was no longer statistically significant (p=0.134). The side difference with contraction of the TrA became less with increasing training age.
Conclusions Right-handed long-term runners without low back pain exhibit a greater right side core muscle activation when performing an isometric contraction.

Results. Hierarchical clustering indicated that the stability of the ICA decomposition incorporating spatiotemporal tensor information performed similarly when compared to current best practice. However, we found that component spatiotemporal stability and convergence of the model varied significantly with model order.

European Journal of Applied Physiology, 119(10), 2185-2199. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-019-04203-9","Purpose. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) usually investigates the corticospinal responses of the agonist muscle to strength training, despite the role of the antagonist muscle in strength development. We examined the intracortical responses from an agonist and antagonist muscle following a single session of heavy-loaded strength training (dominant-arm only) to identify the early antagonistic responses to a single session that may accompany improvements in strength.

Methods. Corticospinal and motor cortical excitability and inhibition was collected from agonist and antagonist muscles prior to and following a single session of heavy-loaded wrist flexor training in 18 individuals. Training consisted of four sets 6–8 repetitions at 80% of 1-repetition maximum (1-RM). Recruitment curves for corticospinal excitability and inhibition of the right wrist flexor and wrist extensor muscles were constructed and assessed by examining the area under the recruitment curve. Intracortical measures were obtained using paired-pulse TMS.

Results. Following a single training session, increases in corticospinal excitability were observed in both the agonist and antagonist muscles. This was accompanied by decreases in corticospinal inhibition in both muscles. Intracortical inhibition was reduced and intracortical facilitation was increased for the agonist muscle only. Intracortical measures in the antagonist muscle remained unchanged after training.

Conclusions. These findings indicate that the corticospinal responses to a single session of strength training are similar between agonist and antagonist muscles, but the intrinsic cortico-cortical circuitry of the antagonist remains unchanged. The corticospinal responses are likely due to increased involvement/co-activation of the antagonist muscle during training as the agonist muscle fatigues.","Purpose.

The influence of word length on reading in individuals with different reading skill levels has been shown in separate eye-tracking and electroencephalography studies. However, the influence of reading difficulty on cortical correlates of word length effect during natural reading is unknown. To investigate how reading skill is related to brain activity during natural reading, we performed an exploratory analysis on our data set from a previous study, where slow reading (N = 27) and typically reading (N = 65) 12-to-13.5-year-old children read sentences while co-registered ET-EEG was recorded. We extracted fixation-related potentials (FRPs) from the sentences using the linear deconvolution approach. We examined standard eye-movement variables and deconvoluted FRP estimates: intercept of the response, categorical effect of first fixation versus additional fixation and continuous effect of word length. We replicated the pattern of stronger word length effect in eye movements for slow readers. We found a difference between typical readers and slow readers in the FRP intercept, which contains activity that is common to all fixations, within a fixation time-window of 50–300 ms. For both groups, the word length effect was present in brain activity during additional fixations; however, this effect was not different between groups. This suggests that stronger word length effect in the eye movements of slow readers might be mainly due re-fixations, which are more probable due to the lower efficiency of visual processing.","Word length is one of the main determinants of eye movements during reading and has been shown to influence slow readers more strongly than typical readers.

Frontiers in Physiology, 10, Article 1164. https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01164","Background: Scapular stabilization is a common focus of shoulder rehabilitation. 
Objective: Examine contraction of serratus anterior during a bilateral arm extension exercise with axial compression using an exercise device (GravityFit) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Methods: MRI was performed under two conditions: rest and static arm extension with axial compression. Load was set at 20% of age, sex and weight estimated bench press one-repetition maximum. A T2-weighted sequence was used to collect 14 axial images of the upper thoracic spine and shoulder bilaterally. Mean muscle length and thickness were calculated for the whole muscle and in equidistant subregions of the muscle in its anterior (superficial), central and posterior (deep) portions. Adjustment of p-values to guard against false positives was performed via the false discovery rate method. 
Results: Nine participants without a history of shoulder or spine pathology were included. When compared to rest, arm extension with the exercise device led to 11% increased overall muscle thickness (P = 0.038) and 6.1% decreased overall muscle length (P = 0.010). Regionally, thickness increased in anterior (superficial, +19%; P = 0.040) and central (+17%; P = 0.028) portions of the muscle more than posterior (deep, +3.9%, P = 0.542). 

Conclusion: Contraction of serratus anterior occurred during static arm extension with axial compression produced by a novel exercise approach, as measured via MRI. The activation of serratus anterior differed across its length with greater contraction of the anterior and central portions. This may indicate compartmentalization of function within this muscle. Overall, the proof-of-principle findings justify the use of this exercise approach for the activation of serratus anterior.","Background: Scapular stabilization is a common focus of shoulder rehabilitation.

Larger responses were observed for the incongruent stimuli than for the congruent stimuli. For the familiarity comparisons no significant differences were found. The results are in line with earlier studies reporting on the modulation of brain responses for audio-visual congruency around 250-500 ms.

Methods: The lumbar spine (Th12/L1–L5/S1) of 101 participants (53.5% female, 30.0[± 3.6]years, 173.5[± 9.6]cm and 69.9[± 13.4]kg), without history of back pain, was examined on a 3T scanner with sagittal T2-mapping. All IVDs were stratified according to Pfirrmann grade and lumbar level, with mean T2-time determined for the entire IVD volume and in five subregions of interests.

Results: Significant level-dependent T2-time differences were detected, both for the entire IVD volume and its subregions. For the entire IVD volume, Pfirrmann grade 2 IVDs displayed 9–18% higher T2-times in Th12/L1 IVDs compared to L2/L3–L5/S1 IVDs (0.001 > p < 0.004) and significantly different T2-times in L1/L2–L2/L3 IVDs compared to most of the IVDs in the lower lumbar spine. In Pfirrmann grades 1, 3 and 4 IVDs, no significant level-dependent T2-time differences were observed for the entire IVD. More pronounced results were observed when comparing IVD subregions, with significant level-dependent differences also within Pfirrmann grade 1 and grade 3 IVDs. For example, in posterior IVD subregions mean T2-time was 80–82% higher in Th12/L1 compared to L3/L4–L4/L5 Pfirrmann grade 1 IVDs (p < 0.05) and 10–14% higher in L5/S1 compared to L3/L4–L4/L5 Pfirrmann grade 3 IVDs (0.02 > p < 0.001).

Discussion: Significant level-dependent T2-time differences within several Pfirrmann grades, both for the entire IVD volume and for multiple IVD subregions, were shown in this large cohort study. The T2-time differences between levels existed in both non-degenerated and degenerated IVDs.

Differing rates of hemispheric maturation could be linked to the proposed functional specialization of the hemispheres in which the left auditory cortex engages in analysis of precise timing information whereas the right auditory cortex focuses on analysis of sound frequency. Here the auditory change detection process for rapidly presented tone-pairs was examined in a longitudinal sample of infants at the age of 6 and 12 months using EEG. The ERP response related to change detection of a frequency contrast, its estimated source strength in the auditory areas, as well as time-frequency indices showed developmental effects. ERP amplitudes, source strength, spectral power and inter-trial phase locking decreased across age. A differential lateralization pattern emerged between 6 and 12 months as shown by inter-trial phase locking at 2–3 Hz; specifically, a larger developmental change was observed in the right as compared to the left hemisphere. Predictive relationships for the change in source strength from 6 months to 12 months were found. Six-month predictors were source strength and phase locking values at low frequencies. The results show that the infant change detection response in rapidly presented tone pairs is mainly determined by low frequency power and phase-locking with a larger phase-locking response at 6 months predicting greater change at 12 months. The ability of the auditory system to respond systematically across stimuli is suggested as a marker of maturational change that leads to more automatic and fine-tuned cortical responses.","Brain responses related to auditory processing show large changes throughout infancy and childhood with some evidence that the two hemispheres might mature at different rates.

In experiment 1, learning was based on feedback provided after each trial. The learning of the audio-visual associations was contrasted with items for which the feedback was meaningless. In experiment 2, learning was based on statistical learning through passive exposure to audio-visual stimuli that were consistently presented with each other and contrasted with audio-visual stimuli that were randomly paired with each other. After 5–10 min of training and exposure, learning-related changes emerged in neural activation around 200 and 350 ms in the two experiments. The MEG results showed activity changes at 350 ms in caudal middle frontal cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus, and at 500 ms in temporo-occipital cortex. Changes in brain activity coincided with a decrease in reaction times and an increase in accuracy scores. Changes in EEG activity were observed starting at the auditory P2 response followed by later changes after 300 ms. The results show that the short-term learning effects emerge rapidly (manifesting in later stages of audio-visual integration processes) and that these effects are modulated by selective attention processes.","Initial stages of reading acquisition require the learning of letter and speech sound combinations.

Frontiers in Psychiatry, 10, Article 130. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00130","Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an affective disorder that is harmful to both physical and mental health. Abnormal self-knowledge, which refers to abnormal judgments about oneself, is a core symptom of depression. However, little research has summarized how and why patients with MDD differ from healthy individuals in terms of self-knowledge.

Objective: To gain a better understanding of MDD, we reviewed previous studies that focused on the behavioral and neurological changes of self-knowledge in this illness.

Main Findings: On the behavioral level, depressed individuals exhibited negative self-knowledge in an explicit way, while more heterogeneous patterns were reported in implicit results. On the neurological level, depressed individuals, as compared with non-depressed controls, showed abnormal self-referential processing in both early perception and higher cognitive processing phases during the Self-Referential Encoding Task. Furthermore, fMRI studies have reported aberrant activity in the medial prefrontal cortex area for negative self-related items in depression. These results revealed several behavioral features and brain mechanisms underlying abnormal self-knowledge in depression.

Future Studies: The neural mechanism of implicit self-knowledge in MDD remains unclear. Future research should examine the importance of others' attitudes on the self-concept of individuals with MDD, and whether abnormal self-views may be modified through cognitive or pharmacological approaches. In addition, differences in abnormal self-knowledge due to genetic variation between depressed and non-depressed populations remain unconfirmed. Importantly, it remains unknown whether abnormal self-knowledge could be used as a specific marker to distinguish healthy individuals from those with MDD.

Conclusion: This review extends our understanding of the relationship between self-knowledge and depression by indicating several abnormalities among individuals with MDD and those who are at risk for this illness.","Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an affective disorder that is harmful to both physical and mental health.

Selvitimme myös menetelmän herkkyyttä tunnistaa kognitiomuutoksia. Menetelmät -- Tutkimus sisälsi haastattelun, kognitiivisen arvioinnin (MoCA), ajon simulaattorilla ja oman ajamisen arvioinnin. Siihen osallistui 7 potilasta ja 17 tervettä ikätoveria. Tulokset -- Potilaat suoriutuivat verrokkeja heikommin MoCA-testissä ja simulaattoriajossa. Arvio omasta suoriutumisesta ajossa oli heillä merkitsevästi parempi kuin verrokeilla. Potilaat saivat testipisteitä keskimäärin 18,6 ja verrokit 27,4. Simulaattoriajossa potilaat tekivät lähes kaksi kertaa enemmän virheitä kuin verrokit. Päätelmät -- Testi näyttää tunnistavan varhaisia kognition muutoksia hyvin.

The aim was also to evaluate the sensitivity of the MoCA to detect the early cognitive impairments in AD. Methods -- Seven individuals with early AD and 17 healthy elderly drivers participated in a driving simulator study consisting of clinical interview, cognitive assessment (MoCA) and simulator drives. After the simulator drives, participants were asked to self-evaluate their driving performance. Results -- AD participants performed worse in both the MoCA test and the simulator drive compared to healthy elderly participants. AD participants also overestimated their driving ability. The overall MoCA score in the AD group was 18.6 compared with 27.4 in the control group. During the simulator drive AD participants made almost twice as many driving errors as healthy controls. Conclusions -- The MoCA seems to be a sensitive screening tool for detecting cognitive impairments in early AD. Anosognosia and deficits in visuospatial abilities, executive functioning and memory seem to increase the safety risk among AD drivers based on the simulator drive. An MoCA score of 20 or less should raise concerns about driving safety.","Muu neurotiede"

However, it is not fully understood how prediction error with different precision levels is minimized in the predictive process. Here, we conducted a magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment which orthogonally manipulated prime-probe relation (for contextual precision) and stimulus repetition (for perceptual learning which decreases prediction error). We presented participants with cycles of tone quartets which consisted of three prime tones and one probe tone of randomly selected frequencies. Within each cycle, the three prime tones remained identical while the probe tones changed once at some point (e.g., from repetition of 123X to repetition of 123Y). Therefore, the repetition of probe tones can reveal the development of perceptual inferences in low and high precision contexts depending on their position within the cycle. We found that the two conditions resemble each other in terms of N1m modulation (as both were associated with N1m suppression) but differ in terms of N2m modulation. While repeated probe tones in low precision context did not exhibit any modulatory effect, repeated probe tones in high precision context elicited a suppression and rebound of the N2m source power.

Here, we aimed to find out whether DSs are important in other types of hippocampus-dependent learning tasks as well. To this end, we trained adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in a spatial reference memory task, a fixed interval task, and a pattern separation task. During a rest period immediately after each training session, we either let neural activity to take place as usual, timed electrical stimulation of the ventral hippocampal commissure (vHC) to immediately follow DSs, or applied the vHC stimulation during a random neural state. We found no effect of vHC stimulation on performance in the spatial reference memory task or in the fixed interval task. Surprisingly, vHC stimulation, especially contingent on DSs, improved performance in the pattern separation task. In conclusion, the behavioral relevance of hippocampal processing and DSs seems to depend on the task at hand. It could be that in an intact brain, offline memory consolidation by default involves associating neural representations of temporally separate but related events. In some cases this might be beneficial for adaptive behavior in the future (associative learning), while in other cases it might not (pattern separation).","Hippocampal dentate spikes (DSs) are short-duration, large-amplitude fluctuations in hilar local field potentials and take place while resting and sleeping.

Although speech perception is also known to play a role in reading development, it is not clear which processes underlie this connection. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) we investigated the speech processing mechanisms for common and uncommon sound contrasts (/ba/-/da/-/ga/ and /ata/-/at: a/) with respect to the native language of school-age children in Finland and the US. In addition, a comprehensive behavioral test battery of reading and phonological processing was administered. ERPs revealed that the children could discriminate between the speech sound contrasts (place of articulation and phoneme length) regardless of their native language. No differences emerged between the Finnish and US children in their change detection responses. The brain responses to the phoneme length contrast, however, correlated robustly with reading scores in the US children, with larger responses being linked to poorer reading skills. Finnish children also showed correlations between the reading and phonological measures and ERP responses, but the pattern of results was not as clear as for the US children. The results indicate that speech perception is linked to reading skills and this link is more robust for uncommon speech sound contrasts.","Development of reading skills has been shown to be tightly linked to phonological processing skills and to some extent to speech perception abilities.

According to existing literature, hippocampal dentate spikes are prominent, short‐duration (<30 ms), large‐amplitude (∼2–4 mV) fluctuations in hilar local‐field potentials that take place during awake immobility and sleep. Interestingly, previous studies indicate that during dentate spikes dentate gyrus granule cells increase their firing while firing of CA1 pyramidal cells are suppressed, thus resulting in momentary uncoupling of the two hippocampal subregions. To date, the behavioural significance of dentate spikes is unknown. Here, to study the possible role of dentate spikes in learning, we trained adult male Sprague–Dawley rats in trace eyeblink classical conditioning. For 1 h immediately following each conditioning session, one group of animals received hippocampal stimulation via the ventral hippocampal commissure (vHC) contingent on dentate spikes to disrupt the uncoupling between the dentate gyrus and the CA1 subregions. A yoked control group was stimulated during immobility, irrespective of brain state, and another control group was not stimulated at all. As a result, learning was impaired only in the group where vHC stimulation was administered contingent on dentate spikes. Our results suggest dentate spikes and/or the associated uncoupling of the dentate gyrus and the CA1 play a significant role in memory consolidation.

We used event-related potentials (ERP) to investigate whether music-induced positive mood has comparable effects on selective attention in the auditory domain. Subjects listened to experimenter-selected happy, neutral or sad instrumental music and afterwards participated in a dichotic listening task. Distractor sounds in the unattended channel elicited responses related to early sound encoding (N1/MMN) and bottom-up attention capture (P3a) while target sounds in the attended channel elicited a response related to top-down-controlled processing of task-relevant stimuli (P3b). For the subjects in a happy mood, the N1/MMN responses to the distractor sounds were enlarged while the P3b elicited by the target sounds was diminished. Behaviorally, these subjects tended to show heightened error rates on target trials following the distractor sounds. Thus, the ERP and behavioral results indicate that the subjects in a happy mood allocated their attentional resources more diffusely across the attended and the to-be-ignored channels.

We studied the effect of the phase of local θ oscillation on hippocampal responses to a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) and subsequent learning of classical trace eyeblink conditioning in adult rabbits. High-amplitude, regular hippocampal θ-band responses (that predict good learning) were elicited by the CS when it was timed to commence at the fissure θ trough (Trough group). Regardless, learning in this group was not enhanced compared with a yoked control group, possibly due to a ceiling effect. However, when the CS was consistently presented to the peak of θ (Peak group), hippocampal θ-band responding was less organized and learning was retarded. In well-trained animals, the hippocampal θ phase at CS onset no longer affected performance of the learned response, suggesting a time-limited role for hippocampal processing in learning. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that timing a peripheral stimulus to a specific phase of the hippocampal θ cycle produces robust effects on the synchronization of neural responses and affects learning at the behavioral level. Our results support the notion that the phase of spontaneous hippocampal θ oscillation is a means of regulating the processing of information in the brain to a behaviorally relevant degree.","Hippocampal θ (3–12 Hz) oscillations are implicated in learning and memory, but their functional role remains unclear.

We studied eight healthy volunteers who underwent 4 wk of unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) to induce chronic unloading. Before and after the ULLS, maximum isometric ankle plantar flexion torque was determined by using a magnetic resonance (MR)-compatible dynamometry. Volumes of the triceps surae muscles and strain distribution of the soleus aponeurosis and the Achilles tendon at a constant submaximal plantar flexion (20% pre-maximal voluntary contraction) were measured by using MRI and velocity-encoded, phase-contrast MRI techniques. Following ULLS, volumes of the soleus and the medial gastrocnemius and the maximum isometric ankle plantar flexion (maximum voluntary contraction) decreased by 5.5 ± 1.9, 7.5 ± 2.7, and 48.1 ± 6.1%, respectively. The strain of the aponeurosis along the length of the muscle before the ULLS was 0.3 ± 0.3%, ranging from −1.5 to 2.7% in different locations of the aponeurosis. Following ULLS, the mean strain was −6.4 ± 0.3%, ranging from −1.6 to 1.3%. The strain distribution of the midregion of the aponeurosis was significantly influenced by the ULLS, whereas the more distal component showed no consistent changes. Achilles tendon strain was not affected by the ULLS. These results raise the issue as to whether these changes in strain distribution affect the functional properties of the triceps surae and whether the probability of strain injuries within the triceps surae increases following chronic unloading in those regions of this muscle complex in which unusual strains occur.","The in vivo strain properties of human skeletal muscle-tendon complexes are poorly understood, particularly following chronic periods of reduced load bearing.

Reconstructions of the anatomy of the human soleus muscle from the Visible Human Dataset (available from the National Library of Medicine), magnetic resonance images (MRI), and cadaver studies revealed a complex 3D connective tissue structure populated with pennate muscle fibers. The posterior aponeurosis and the median septum of the soleus form the insertion of the muscle and are continuous with the Achilles tendon. The distal extremities of the pennate muscle fibers attach to these structures. The anterior aponeurosis is located intramuscularly, between the posterior aponeurosis and the median septum. It forms the origin of the muscle and contacts the proximal extremities of the soleus muscle fibers. MRI measurements of in vivo tissue velocities during isometric contractions (20% and 40% maximum voluntary contractions) revealed a similarly complex 3D distribution of tissue movements. The distribution of velocities was similar to the distribution of major connective tissue structures within the muscle. During an isometric contraction, muscle fiber contractions move the median septum and posterior aponeurosis proximally, relative to the anterior aponeurosis. The pennate arrangement of muscle fibers probably amplifies muscle fiber length changes but not sufficiently to account for the twofold difference in muscle fiber length changes relative to excursion of the calcaneus. The discrepancy may be accounted for by an additional gain mechanism operating directly on the Achilles tendon by constraining the posterior movement of the tendon, which would otherwise occur due to the increasingly posterior location of the calcaneus in plantarflexeion.","This article investigates how the internal structure of muscle and its relationship with tendon and even skeletal structures influence the translation of muscle fiber contractions into movement of a limb.

Recent advances in experimental techniques allow in vivo measurements of muscle–tendon architecture and function. In particular, the use of ultrasonography for measurement of tendon and muscle has expanded our knowledge in the last decade. Furthermore, the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is opening up new insights not only for three-dimensional anatomical information but also for examining musculo-skeletal motion in vivo. While these two completely non-invasive methods provide kinematic data, in vivo force measurements still require somewhat invasive procedures and are scarce. Thus, muscle forces are frequently calculated using both simple and complex models. These models can give us suggestions for further experimental work. There is a need to examine the experimental data ranging from single-fiber experiments to the muscle function in human movement in order to understand the muscle–tendon function in vivo fully. Furthermore, appreciation of the structure–function relationships may help us to understand the entity of muscle–tendon function both from the perspective of mechanical behavior and neural control.","This paper reviews the architectural details and the in vivo behavior of the human muscle–tendon unit with the focus on the triceps surae and quadriceps femoris muscles.
